0,Vellore-Institute-of-Technology-Vellore,Can I get into the ECE branch at VIT Chennai with 92 percent marks? I did not attempt the JEE January.,0,1,0/1,No,Requested,2020-07-26,https://www.quora.com/Can-I-get-into-the-ECE-branch-at-VIT-Chennai-with-92-percent-marks-I-did-not-attempt-the-JEE-January,"Not sure. I do not knowcwhat the JEE is but i figure that it is a major test. In our schools, 100 is perfection and an A. If on that scale then a 92 is great! A good idea for you is to study and get in touch withVIT Chennai to see what all of their requirements are to get into their ECE branch. It also could be posted somewhere. Work hard to get where you want to be, you seem to be on the right track. Do not be nervous, afraid or worry. You can do this, it's all up to you! And if something wrong happens, maybe you can sit for/take the test again. Good luck! "

All the Indian engineering colleges inflate their placement stats because all such stats are made by Indian education mafia. There is NO concept of placement from VIT like fraud colleges. MOST of the degree holders from such colleges are shifted as clerks in the services based companies owned by the college owners. 3–4 LPA.There is NO concept of campus placement from such colleges because campus placement happens when an engineering company needs engineers and such companies visit many colleges to fill some core engineering positions. Since NONE of the companies carrying out campus placement at such tier-4 Indian engineering colleges do engineering but some random clerical works hence such companies are called as services based companies.IITs are going to die because of the fake news propagated by Indian education mafia: Praveen Kumar Singh's answer to What has happend to all the IITians who joined Google, Microsoft and Facebook at INR 2 crore salaries.

So if you see BITS, even the core engineering students are more interested in Coding, non tech, finance related jobs which focuses on analytical skill & problem solving skills rather than hardcore engineering skill.. Though few students love their core engineering but they also prefer to go for MS than working in core sector.. The under graduate research is low.. the other factor can be because these students are not taught generic subjects till 2nd year so the interests are diverse.. Coming to NITT, this is typically like a good government Institute have a very well defined syllabus.. but these hardly gets updated.. the students are mix bag.. some going for higher studies, some for non core & some even work in core sector.. typically since it's in Tamil Nadu, good professors are available & it has a legacy of good research.. but NITT really lags in MOU with foreign universities.. Coming to VIT, it started growing in much later stage.. but in recent years they have shown tremendous growth.. now here it's completely opposite of BITS.. here from 1st year itself students are exposed to their subject rather than studying generic subjects.. it also offers specializations like AI-ML, Bigdata, Cyber security right in undergrad CSE along with generic CSE.. VIT really push Research & has MOU with several foreign universities.. the students from those Universities do come for exchange programme & also VIT students do go.. Now the basic cons of VIT is it has huge crowd & also it has category systems.. so along with good student, you will find some average student also got admitted by giving more fees, which brings the average IQ down.. but the 1st category students are really good & university provides an top class infrastructure to students & top Engineering Companies from each field come for placement.. So this is my point of view. I tried to give an unbiased review..hope this helps "

I am discussing only the important ones in details. Smoking free and Alcohol free campus: Smoking and alcohol consumption is strictly prohibited inside the campus. If any student comes drunk from outside and if the guards get suspicious, they can take you for alcohol test also. If you are caught, then authority can suspend you for 1 month or rest of the semester, debar you from the exams, can even impose heavy fines alongside informing your guardian.Maintaining discipline in library: Authority maintains strict vigilance to make the library reader friendly. You cannot speak on phone, cannot listen to anything on mobile/laptop putting on volume, cannot chic chat with any friends loudly and ofcourse you have to wear your ID card always.Campus in-out timings: This one is very strictly followed in case of female students. Any student(hostel boarders) if they want to take any leave for overnight stay outside campus, he/she has to get it approved by HOD or concerned faculty member. Inside campus, girls (after 8 pm) and boys (after 8:30) cannot roam about. The guards will continue to blow whistles till you get inside your hostel.Apart from these, the entire campus is under CCTV surveillance, so none should try their luck to break the rules. The journey at VIT will be a worthy one to remember. So enjoy it and give your full effort. Some restrictions are necessary in our life to make us disciplined. So it is good to abide by them. All the best."

VITEEE exam is the gate pass for the candidates applying for the undergraduate Engineering admissions at VIT. Since it is practically impossible to conduct an offline exam in this corona Pandemic, the exams are cancelled. In order to get into VIT, the candidate should have 60% aggregate of PCM/PCB in the qualifying examination, perhaps the board exams. So, it wholly depends on the scores that you have scored in your majors. On the other hand, JEE Mains score can be contemplated, in case if you're pushed at the edge of your screening. But JEE Mains score is not significantly considered, for VIT admissions. Calculate your aggregate. Accordingly, you can evaluate yourself either you can get into VIT or you can go for looking forward some other best colleges. Good Luck! "

VIT is a private college which stands as top 1 private college in India where as CUSAT is a government college with autonomous affiliated.VIT takes high amount of money per year(1.5 lpa for study and 90000 for hostel) as it is a private university but in case of CUSAT it is not.As VIT takes that amount of money from students it’s facility is very good like its infrastructure, food, extracurricular activites and most importantly placement. where as in CUSAT mostly facility is not that much of good and also placement is depend upon your scores.VIT provides high packages jobs to the students from many product based companies. Where as in CUSAT if you pass all the exams then you will get a campus.VIT extracurricular activities are also good where you can participate in many competitions and you can win money. where as CUSAT mostly extracurricular activities is there but not that much of good.In VIT study pressure is high so that you can clear a campus but in CUSAT study pressure is no there.During campus placement you can seat n number of companies but when you will get 3 offer letters in your hand after that you can’t seat where as in CUSAT when you will get 1 offer letter after that you can’t seat for placement.According to my point of view for 2 years only you have to spent money in VIT after that you will get a good offer letters and your future will be settled. And also in this 2 years for 1 year 3 months you have to study and after that you have to do internships in which company you got placed. And also if you don’t like that job then again you can switch to different company in which you have cleared. But in CUSAT only one offer letter you will get. If you are not satisfied then also you can’t switch to another company. I hope this much of information must helped you. Thanks for reading my answers. "

Anyway, you won't have much interaction with wardens unless and until you commit some actions which would invite their attention. Illegal activities By illegal, I mean, stuff that isn't allowed inside hostels. VIT is extremely serious about things like these. If you're caught smoking or drinking inside hostels, then you'll face heavy fines. If I'm not wrong, you'll get 3 strikes after which a serious action will be taken against you (possibly, expelled or a semester-back). Hope this helps.

Conduct a quantitative study of YOUR OWN - compare and use rankings of not one or two, but a number of ranking systems - NIRF, THE, QS - there are a lot. Now don’t just go and compare and say “X is at rank 1 whereas as Y is at rank 2, so it is obviously better!” - dig deep. What metrics are they using? Are the metrics biased? Are the metrics inclined towards factors that don’t have a proper definition ? (like “reputation”) How have the rankings improved over the years? Is the university stagnant? Or worse are the ranks dropping? Does the university have appropriate accreditation? For placements, go through each of the university websites and collect data directly from them. Not from Quora, not from your neighbor but directly from their website. If for some reason, they don’t have the data, contact the college (also possibly a red flag) Go through their social media handles. Find what else the university does, research aspects, etc. It is easy to read Quora and read one guy saying “X is at rank 1 by ABC ranking - it is the best!!!” and some others saying the complete opposite. This is something you have to do because it is your responsibility to make sure that you don’t end up in a place where you don’t want to be. For comparing numbers, do not read people’s opinions, they are almost always biased and that is something you cannot afford for the first part of your study. It is, by no doubts, a painstaking long process but once you have a firm ground to stand, you can think of running :) 2 - A purely opinion based study The numbers play no part for this part of the study. By opinion of people, I do not mean random strangers you find on Quora or any website - I mean the students. Approach students from the colleges in question, preferably ask one from each year - 1st, 2nd, 3rd and final year (if it’s B.Tech) Ask them relevant questions - how is the campus atmosphere? Is the teaching diligent? Are assignments and exams conducted just for the sake of conducting? Is there ragging? How friendly are the seniors? Are there student clubs? How good are the student clubs? How good are the hostels? Are the faculty approachable? Is the administration too strict/ too lax? What are some common nuisances that you face? Try to connect with the alumni too, if possible, they would be undoubtedly much more wise. How can you connect with these people? Well the world is your oyster - Quora, Facebook, Instagram, Twitter - endless ways to do it. Try to ask as many people as possible, so you make sure you reduce the chance of bias. Don’t hesitate, because your future depends upon it! Doing this, you might make some friends who might just play a crucial role in your life ;) I will reiterate what I have said before for the previous section - This is something you have to do because it is your responsibility to make sure that you don’t end up in a place where you don’t want to be. On a final note, the numbers matter less, in my opinion, because numbers can’t capture each and every aspect of the hundreds of factors that go into play. For instance, campus atmosphere. What’s the point if a college claims top placements but most of the students in a class are engaged doing illicit activities like drugs? What a student says about a college has more weight. Because he has been there, lived there. He or she has already committed and put trust on the college and he or she knows more than just those rankings you see on college websites. Those things play a role of course, but don’t over emphasize. At the end of they day, it’s your call to make. Regarding Amrita, I can certainly help you with the second part since I study in Amritapuri. I’m a B.Tech (CSE) Student at Amrita, Amritapuri (2018–22). The strongest factor in favor of Amrita, in my humble opinion, is its student club culture. Amritapuri hosts two of India’s top student clubs - amFOSS and Team bi0s. amFOSS is India’s leading FOSS and Computer Science club and bi0s is India’s ranked 1 cybersecurity team in CTFs since the last many years. More info on respective websites. I joined amFOSS in 2018, in my first year. Since then, I have been a Google Summer of Code Student in 2019, a Google Summer of Code Mentor this year, gave a couple of talks at international conferences (funded) and have a had a hell of a time so far with seniors and peers who are nothing more than family now. I will clarify - I spent every day after class at amFOSS Lab, received guidance, worked my ass off - just like my peers and seniors there. It wasn’t magic. It took work. Days and weeks and months of work. But only work doesn’t pay it off, the right exposure and guidance helps, and it multiplies your effort exponentially. Now these aren’t the only clubs, there are other great clubs as well. For instance, Code@Amrita, which is a competitive programming club. The team has a history of participating in ICPC World Finals twice. Non-CS branches have active clubs as well - HuT Labs, Baja, Supra and so on - you will find details of them on the Amrita website. So campus atmosphere? 10/10 if you make use of it ;) Ragging? None. I personally haven’t faced a situation nor have most of my friends. The administration is pretty strict about it (as they should be) so no need to worry. The hostels are OK. The first year hostel isn’t awesome but it gets a lot better after first year. ( Also I think they are constructing a new one for first years ) Food? This is subjective. It’s not bad but it’s certainly getting better. Comparing to my first year, the food is much better. The seniors agree with me. It is not bland but the food serves its purposes but it does take some getting used to. There are, of course, hotels nearby. Internet? The college provides WiFi in and around the campus and the hostels. The speed is decent enough - anywhere from 1 to 5+ Mbps depending on time and location. Faculty? All of whom I’ve encountered so far have been very friendly and approachable and that could be said to all of them, in general. Most of the classes have projectors and stuff, the labs are cool and most of the time, doesn’t feel “outdated” (as my peers from other colleges tend to say) Overall, administration and faculty are OK. Any other questions? Drop them below. Good luck!

Well yes, but actually no. If you think about it, there are a huge number of people studying in VIT and FFCS happens for all students of a particular year at the same time. So, unless and until you have a very good internet connection (and luck, for bonus) you will have a really hard time getting good teachers and subjects.The problem of clashing slots. In VIT, every subject has a slot assigned to it and on the basis of that, the time-table is made. So, scenarios might occur where you want to take 2 subjects but both of them are available for the same slot, in that case, you'll have to sacrifice one subject amongst the two.I hope this gives you an overwiew or at least an idea about what is the procedure for subject selection in VIT.

There are a huge number of subjects you can take if you include all the options for UE from other branches. But the sheer number of students trying for these subjects might not let you take the subjects you want, so you need to be quick about picking them up. Each subject can have multiple slots for both theory and lab-components (depending on the credit distribution of the subject you want), and multiple teachers as well, so you can shortlist multiple options for the slot and the faculty. You need to be careful about choosing your UEs though. Before choosing the subjects you want for that semester, it is better to clarify if it is counted as a UE for your branch. Otherwise, you will not see that subject at all during your FFCS registration, which means your credits balance for that semester can go awry and you might be forced to take random subjects if you are worried about finishing those credits. FFCS is an experience in itself, so if you are a student of VIT, it’s going to be one that you will remember for quite a while. "

In case you’ve been to a great coaching institute and liked the teachers there, you’ll be let down. I would say in the 1st semester atleast the faculties won’t be particularly good. But in following semesters as you start doing your core subjects, there are plenty good faculty to choose from. Anyway, what really matters is avoiding faculties that make life more difficult than it has to be. In mechanical at least there aren’t many such faculties unlike EEE and ECE which are already tough branches and have poor faculties as well. I met a guy in Mech who did some research under a few different highly qualified faculties and got accepted into Harvard for 3D printing research. So yeah. VIT will open a lot of doors for you if you choose right faculty and are interested in academics. On the flip side it is all too easy to go to your AC room and just binge watch YouTube, tv shows and play Counter Strike all day online as we get unlimited WiFi access. Also try joining good people for projects as you will get a good project to attach to your resume and speak about in interviews. I think now semester projects (not capstone) grp size is limited to 3. When I joined in 2016 we could have 7–8 people in groups. So i made a lot of friends this way and had some fun. So yeah hope this helps. Also a big factor in doing well is having good roommates who don’t just watch movies and play games all day else you’ll be tempted to. I liked my experience, never had any trouble with faculty or any wardens. I genuinely feel bad for people missing out on hostel experiences due to Corona. "

BUT, it does not matter. I have in front of me my package of Vitamin B12 tablets. They are listed at 5000 mcg, which is 208333% of the recommended daily value. The typical general supplemental dose of vitamin B12 is 1-25 mcg per day: The recommended dietary allowances (RDAs) of vitamin B12 are: 1.8 mcg; older children and adults, 2.4 mcg; pregnant women, 2.6 mcg; and breast-feeding women, 2.8 mcg. You are getting about the RDA rather than a massive overdose. Now, to hear the truth about vitamins at the mcg level. When tablets are made, or capsules filled, with very small quantities of vitamins or minerals such as the mcg amount of Vitamin B12 you are actually getting the statistical average of the amount listed. There is no practical method of getting that exact value in a tablet or capsule. As an example, say a 1000 lb batch of the vitamin mix is made to produce tablets. Let us say the finished tablet that you take is 0.35 g and the expected dose of Vitamin B12 is about 2.6 mcg. In the metric system, 1000 milligrams (mg) is a unit of mass equal to 1 gram and 1000 micrograms (mcg) is equal to 1 milligram (mg). Using the above figures you see that a microgram (mcg) is a very tiny part of a milligram and even smaller part of a gram. So the vitamin mixture has the amount of Vitamin B12 mixed into the 100o lb. so that mathematically it is at the correct proportion. On paper it is exact, but after mixing and moving and filling into a tablet die or a capsule you have some variance. Drug companies provide an overage from the labeled amount to be certain of having an amount that according to statistics will give you at least the labeled amount. The math involved is not complex, but boring. So, rest assured that you will not be seriously vitamin deficient if you take the 2.4 mcg tablet or the 2.65 mcg tablet. "

Since, you didn’t mention your branch, my answer will be specific to Computer Science, IT and Electrical. If you want CS or IT, without any doubt you can take admission in VIT either in Vellore or Chennai campus only.

Suggestion: For now, fill the January JEE main score. Wait for the rank in VITEEE. If you are getting CSE or IT than only proceed with counselling, else drop the idea to join here. Give your best in September or in BITS or next year for two scenarios 1) You need ECE, Mechanical, CIvil. 2) You are not getting CS or IT in two campuses Vellore, Chennai. You can take EC also, but I won’t recommend because VIT takes lots of students every year and most of the companies come to recruit are from IT department. A huge competition is there for non CS branches as they have to compete with CS students and must possess good coding skills also. Always go after better opportunities. If you feel you are well prepared with JEE Main and in this one and half month you can revise properly and do well in the upcoming September exam. GO FOR IT….!!! Life in old IIT’s and top notch NIT’s would be far better in terms of placements and learning opportunities. The choice is yours. So, provide your old JEE rank and see what rank are you getting in VITEEE. If you are in top 3000, then definitely you will get either CSE or IT in Chennai or Vellore in first category. Hope it helps! "

Now a days every colleges are introducing AI, ML courses since all the MNCs (product based companies mostly) are using these new technologies. But every institute needs skill faculties to teach such courses, by adding a course doesn't prove that the Institute brand's value will increase. The brand will be dependent if quality teaching will be provided. IISC started their first AI batch in 2018, till now no data has been found regarding placements but the quality there is superb since highly skilled faculties are available. Similarly, IIT Kgp, ISI Kolkata these are the top Institutes for AI, ML and the reason is “top notch faculties” who have intense knowledge and have dynamic projects in their hand. So, it will solely depend on the Guide who will be taking that course in VIT and Amrita. If he's good enough and knows quality research and working in good projects than only more students will be attracted to that course and the brand value will increase. Just for name sake, it's not better to opt any specialization course in such Institutes where data is not known. By the way I am from VIT and I know VIT has top class CS faculties, but AI faculties and their research fields are not known. Similarly for Amrita. So, firstly students should know the curriculum, faculty handling it, projects that the faculty is handling and his/her research field etc. These datas can be obtained from Alumni or present students who are in the same branch. Another way is doing NPTEL courses. Hope it helps! "

There are reviews, demos, presentations every now and then, you’ll have to write research paper for every project . Apart from these the faculties are very supportive and will guide you throughout your project and can even arrange fundings for you. The infrastructure in VIT is world class and you can literally work on any technology exist in the world. So Yess, the pressure is there and that’s what makes it a MASTER’s course as a clear practical exposure is there for many new age technology.

The curfew time for freshers is 9:00 pm and for seniors it's 9:30 pm. You HAVE to be inside hostel after this time otherwise you can face penalties. But, if you want to enjoy the night life of VIT's campus, then there's a way around this too. After you get into any club/chapter/team then you can apply for night slips which allow you to stay outside of your hostel (still inside the campus though) till 1:00 am. Wardens There cannot be a definitve answer on this. It's like asking, “How is every person in a particular country?”. It varies, some wardens are super chill whereas some are super strict. Anyway, you won't have much interaction with wardens unless and until you commit some actions which would invite their attention. Illegal activities: By illegal, I mean, stuff that isn't allowed inside hostels. VIT is extremely serious about things like these. If you're caught smoking or drinking inside hostels, then you'll face heavy fines. If I'm not wrong, you'll get 3 strikes after which a serious action will be taken against you (possibly, expelled or a semester-back). Hope this helps.

Prepare for the upcoming JEE if you have filled the form and if not go for any other state college.You will get the best state college with this percentile. They will be much better than VIT. The dream package in VIT is 5 lakhs which is even less than the average package of many colleges. Also, VIT will charge a lot for your 4 years.

515,Vellore-Institute-of-Technology-Vellore,Is VIT is good for M.tech biomedical?,1,1,1/1,No,Followed,2020-07-15,https://www.quora.com/Is-VIT-is-good-for-M-tech-biomedical,"Thanks for A2A. For a comprehensive understanding, I have written my answer a bit long, explaining Course work at VITPlacements at VITWhy do students come to VIT ?Final take.Take your time. Also, This is my review. I would recommend you to get more reviews on M.Tech Biomedical at VIT from others and then make an informed decision. VIT Vellore Institute of Technology (VIT) offers Biomedical Engineering course for both B.Tech and M.Tech. Biomedical Coursework at VIT B.Tech Biomedical course in VIT is designed like > 3 years course work and ~ 9 months internship/project term for your B.Tech Thesis. Due to fully-flexible credit system (FFCS), in this period of 4 years, students can learn “any” subject or language (even from other fields like IT, CS, EXTC, Mathematics and Statistics, etc) to their liking along with their structured course work for Biomedical. M.Tech Biomedical course at VIT consists of 1 year and 2 months of course work and ~ 9 months of intership /project term for you M.Tech Thesis. FFCS is applicable to M.Tech as well and students can learn “any” subject or language along with their structured course work in Biomedical. For both B.Tech and M.Tech, in FFCS, there is a minimum number of credits, a student has to obtain through the structured course work and it is easily obtained by “all” students through their assignments, exams and mini-projects. For the “extra” subjects or languages one has studied during the years, the student is expected to “pay” for those subjects (~ 5K per paper) and only then is the course completion (CC) certificate is given to the student. Without CC, the student is not “permitted” to the next year in case of B.Tech and degree certificate is not “issued” in case of M.Tech. M.Tech Biomedical engineering course at VIT is not comprehensive. The common understanding that M.Tech means “specialization” or advanced studies in the field, is lacking in the M.Tech Biomedical course at VIT. A student will not learn “anything new” in his/her MTech Biomedical course. All the subject/papers that he/she has learnt in his/her B.Tech are “repeated” as it was. In short, in terms of learning, M.Tech Biomedical at VIT offers nothing new. Although, this is not the case with other M.Tech programs at VIT. VIT is one of the bests, for M.Tech courses like VLSI Design, Structural engineering, Mechanical Engineering, IOT, CS, Biotechnology Engineering and Nanotechnology Engineering. However, the M.Tech Biomedical Engineering at VIT is not so good. There are other institutes in India itself, that offer a biomedical specialization like M.Tech Biomedical Engineering in Biomedical Instrumentation, M.Tech Biomedical Engineering in Medical Image Processing, M.Tech Biomedical Engineering in Hospital Administration, etc , to name a few. Compared to these, M.Tech Biomedical Engineering at VIT is just not up to the mark. Placements at VITBiomedical placements at VIT are slim, as very few core Biomedical companies come to VIT. It doesn’t matter much for the B.Tech course because, many students just align themselves towards IT and CS industries after their B.Tech course for good pay. And many many core IT and semicondutor companies come to VIT every year and plenty of students get placed with very good pay. Many Biomedical Engineers do get placed in these IT industries with good pay. VIT allows Biomedical and other non-IT branches to sit for these campus placements but it ultimately depends on the company that comes for the placements. If an IT company decides, they do not want any non-IT branches this year, it is nothing much that VIT can do, and this is understandable. Having said that, many biomedical students find internships outside VIT for their final year thesis project, with the of contacts from faculty like in IITs, NITs, etc or from their own sources. Some students do their thesis projects from VIT itself. Some of these internships get converted into job offers later. M.Tech Biomedical placements at VIT is very very slim. As mentioned earlier, very few biomedical core companies come to VIT. It is like finding a needle in a haystack. Students find their own internships outside VIT for their final year thesis project and some of these get converted into job offers later. Others just do their thesis projects from VIT itself. Then, Why do students come to VIT ? The brand name, VIT, has more weight than any other college/institute in India. It is not a joke that, VIT is compared with IITs, NITs, BITs, etc. All of this brand name is due to other branches like EXTC, IT, CS, VLSI Design, etc. Each year, many students from VIT bag job offers from MNCs like Amazon, Google, Microsoft, Intel, Qualcomm, Microchip Semiconductors, Honeywell, etc. with more than 4 lac package, on an average. Seeing these, parents and students get excited for their futures, and it is true. VIT is just great for IT-related branches. In fact, with the amount of opportunities one gets at VIT, it is even better than some IITs for some B.Tech courses. At VIT, students also get to do their semesters abroad at premium institutes. Students who unfortunately fail to get into such giants, get into some other good companies (on their own merit), just with the “degree” from VIT. As mentioned earlier, VIT as a brand is very very big. Many students get into these giants, off-campus, that is, they attend these interviews outside VIT or even after their courses, and this magical name “VIT” gives them edge over other candidates at the interview. VIT, as a brand, ofcourse has weight when going for higher studies abroad, since it is compared with premium indian institutes like IITs, NITs and the BITs. All of these make VIT a wholesome package, and students from all over India ( many from other countries too), flock like birds to get their degrees from VIT. Finally, No single college/institute is best in all aspects. Everyone has their own advantages, pitfalls and preferences. M.Tech Biomedical at VIT is “okay”. If one is interested in just getting a “degree” from VIT, then it is best for him. If one is interested in getting advanced skills and learning new things in the field, then VIT may not be the best. Anyway, what matters is, in the long-run, it turns out to be good. As for me, I did find my internship outside VIT and after completing my M.Tech Biomedical at VIT, I am now placed in the same research institute with good pay in hand. This is my review, I would recommend you to get more reviews on M.Tech Biomedical at VIT from others and then make an informed decision. All the best! "

But still the question arise then why they are asking to upload JEE main Score so the reason will be to eliminate student’s by JEE Main score Like if someone score 98 percent in Board but only 74 percentile then wil he be able to get sit in college then i think yes but if someone scoring JEE 90 percentile but board only 65 percent then i think he/she might not get seat these are my guessing and it can be wrong it will be much clear if VIT clarify about this. I think the admission will be solely on board marks but there can be chance where this scenario may come where they can make cutoff For Board student with JEE marks different and only Board appeared student’s different cutoff this might be a chance and here JEE marks will play role. Taking an example Student having JEE+12 board mark cutoff will be assuming 80 percent in board and 60 percentile in JEE whereas the cutoff for only board appeared student might be 85 percent or something like this this is just my opinion and thinking it may differ what VIT offical thinks and i tried to give you some idea and clear doubts and help you to know the possible scenario.Let’s Hope For the Best.

So yeah, it is indeed a huge student population but considering the fact that the campus stretches over a 300 acre area, the density does not feel that profound.

Homesickness- Every hosteller faces this, moments of nostalgia and when you start missing the comfort of your home, especially if it's your first time staying away from home.Mess food- Now I personally find the mess food satisfying, as they provide a menu for a month, to avoid repetitive dishes. However, it might be a bit difficult for you to adjust to this.Assignments - All assignments have strict due dates, beyond which full marks will not be awarded even if your solutions are a 100% correct. This is because all the assignments are uploaded digitally and lack of uploaded files leads to an automatic zero.Hostel stay - The hostel does not permit personal possessions of electronic devices such as iron boxes or hair straighteners. This might be a bit challenging. Apart from that, there are strict hostel in times (curfew), beyond which you'll have to pay a fine.These are a few of the problems that you might encounter. I can assure you that you won't face any problems regarding the availability if facilities or shops for necessary items, as all these are available within the hostel as well as outside the campus. Besides, the campus is reallyyyyy vast and it will take some time to getting used to which building is where. This also means lots of walking between classes, keeping you active and healthy😜 Hope you have a great time here at VIT! "

VIT intimates before hand when this FFCS will happen .FFCS always happens in VIT website.Students have to login in with their credentials and start their registration. Course registration happens in a hierarchical manner i.e fourth years and third years will be given priority first and then second and first years.There is nothing to worry ,everyone will be allotted with some course or the other.One thing,students have to be really carefully while choosing faculty as it may have a tremendous impact on your grades and performance in the semester is always better to consult your seniors regarding which faculty to choose. For the first semester(NO FFCS) as students would be new to the system,VIT only will allot faculty and timetable. If you have any further doubts fell free to join the whatsapp group.

Ull literally find all types of people. Like, intellectuals, book worms, celebs, copy cats, lazy potatoes, etc.. be sure you are not falling into copy cats as ull regret that there is no point in taking other's assignments just for handling gpa(which u are now worrying about). So take every academic assignment or project of yours seriously.If u feel the faculty is a douche n he knows nothing, try to use other sources to learn but dont ignore the subject.Focusing for a better cgpa shouldn't be the reason to quit or avoid extra curriculars, atleast try before thinking to quit.Stay healthy - I got so used of going to night canteen everyday skipping dinner, I got a fat big belly before I could notice. And ALWAYS keep a check on ur sleep cycle. Night outs might sound fancy, but trust me.. once ure used to delayed sleep cycle, there will definitely be a point where ure fighting with ur pillow trying to sleep.Lastly, about the curriculum. I felt it is no lesser framed compared to other universities abroad, but the only down point is with faculty, which I believe anybody with pure thirst to seek knowledge won't just rely on a whining old balloon. Try to take different courses in elective baskets, not confining to a single stream. In the management and humanities baskets, you'll find courses with less stress and more fun. For ex.,I loved taking basic french, Spanish, psychology etc. Under humanities. I basically like learning new languages.So that's all from me. This might not seem more vit specific, but it's good either way. All the best!"

Freshers: As a fresher, hostels are allocated based on your wish (and, first-come-first-serve). You can pay for any room type as per your wish and it will be allocated to you instantly (again, depends on availability). Also, you don’t have any say in choosing your roommates. 2nd year onwards: Oh boy! Here onwards things become rough. From 2nd year till the 4th year, you’ll get rooms based on your University rank which will depend on your CGPA. The more CGPA you have, the better rank you’ll get and thus, more chances of getting a better room. BUT, there’s a way around this too! For example, if you want a 3-bedded room in your 2nd year but you don’t have the adequate CGPA for that, you can still get the room if one of your roommates have a better CGPA than yours. (yes, 2nd year onwards, you can choose your own roommates, yay!). If you have any more doubts, feel free to ask in the comments. Cheers :) "

So you will find maximum teachers in these categories and its always better to get reviews from seniors to choose the right faculty as some faculties will make you fall in love with the subject and some faculties will help you so much throughout your college life with things you can't even imagine. WHICH FACULTY TO CHOOSE? If you find a professor whose name is starting “Gopi”, choose him right there without a doubt. Gopinath and Gopichand are one of these Gopi Gang.Teachers whose names are starting with Saira are great teachers and will teach you extremely well but they are strict too.TOC-Debi Prassana and Kannadasan are the best, literally THE BEST!! Uma Devi is also a great teacher and she will make sure you learn the subject but again its always better to be in her good books as then she is the most lovable faculty I have ever met.For Computer Networks and Digital Logic- You will not have much choice here but try to take Madhu Vishwanathan as he is a god sent a gift to every student. Gayatri Mam and Shanthi Mam are faculties who have a good knowledge of there field but are a little strict but if you wish to learn you have to bear with that.CSE Faculties who take electives and core- Anisha, DON S, Anil Kumar and take them for whichever subject they are taking as these faculties are damn great.KAUSER AHMED-RIPTry to take new faculties as quite a few are really friendly and helpful and also choose your lab faculties wisely as no one is going to write those MATLAB codes by themselves."

Also is VIT returning the money collected for the form I mean atleast return the money they would have used to conduct the exam( I am not sure if they are returning it or not , let me know in the comments). Now what I feel would have been a viable solution is conducting an aptitude or affinity test for the branch of your liking. Like students give their branches of choice a then they remotely give a test to see which branch suits them the most.

Edit: The IISERAT has been postponed indefinitely (date yet to be announced), and registration deadline has been extended to 16th August.

It is really big deal to get students admitted through Board score as the level of them is extremely different and normalization procedure for state boards,CBSE,ICSE is even a heavy task. Even if you consider JEE JAN score, there are many people who haven't attempted and many more who can do better. Also,IIT s and NIT s have almost majority intellectual peer communities compared to others and all of them have cracked ONE OF the “Most toughest engineeting entrance exams in INDIA and probably ASIA"" Getting admissions through board marks and JEE percentile is NOT even FAIR. Because there are many students who are not well prepared for boards and first attempt of MAINS in January and can improve very much in second one. Considering Droppers,they have taken a major risk in their life of spending one more year to crack their dream exam and go to their dreamt IIT s. It is like throwing their dreams and effort into ashes. On a conclusion, VITEEE is a private entrance exam and is attempted by students of probably 4–5 states across India and no one would dare to take a drop year for such an exam. But, Most of the students can't even think of cancelling JEE MAIN and ADVANCED and getting admitted through Boards and PREVIOUS MAIN PERCENTILE … It is highly UNFAIR JEE must be and will be conducted some day. So, don't think much about it and just improve yourself as we have got a lot of extra time.We should feel LUCKY to get such a long time as we can sharpen our skills during these times. At the same time,we should also beware that this time cutoff might increase drastically. KEEP STUDYING ALL THE BEST "

Let’s ponder some facts : VIT Vellore’s CSE cutoff rank is 15k in VITEEE. This will decrease for sure if we just consider JEE mains (as students will go to other colleges too).No. of students securing 90%+ are around 30k in cbse board alone(science).So these points make it very difficult to predict anything unless untill thw univeristy provides any clarity. Personnel opinion : As VIT is a prestigious Engineering College we expect it to admit good student crowd, thereby we hope to see more weightage to JEE mains. Thus at 98.5 percentile you most probably will get CSE at VIT Vellore. Hope this helped. "

This year due to the whole covid-19 scenario, the VITEEE exams are cancelled and nothing like this has ever happened before, so it is very tough to presict or conclude anything as no statistics or past experiences are available on this. Your scores are decent enough but let me be clear with the fact that CSE(Core) is a very tough branch to get in any college, as it goes without saying it is the most popular engineering branch nowadays due to the high placement ratio. When i joined VIT(Vellore) back in 2016 , the ranks upto 5k could only get CSE in Vellore Campus, which is of course subjected to change as it depends on the number of people taking up the branch before you get your turn. VIT offers many specializations In CSE like the bioinfotmatics specialization but they too get over mostly 7k rank generally. There is management quota in VIT which can fetch you the branch even at 50k rank, but only if your pocket allows as it goes as high as around 40lacs for 4 years. You can compromise the campus choice, which means you can join Bhopal, Amravati, Chennai because during the placements you come to Vellore campus anyway if you are shortlisted for interviews.

See, dropping an year and preparing well for next year JEE is far better than wasting money by giving whole admission fees and hostel fees, where the whole semester will be online mode for sure. Till 2021, this semester will be completely online in all the colleges. Hope it helps! "

It means there can be other branch candidate higher to your rank, so it means a civil engineer Ranking higher than you will not opt for CS. Means if top 200 rank are all Mechanical students in VITMEE and you are 201 as electronics guy. So VLSI has around 100+ seats, so does it mean that you will not get VLSI??? So, consideration of above example, with 201 rank in VITMEE you are 1st candidate in electronics ( means Topper in VITMEE in electronics stream) so definitely you will get VLSI. Now coming to VITMEE 2020 Rank, due to pandemic situation ranking criteria is based on GATE marks and BTech Marks, so here too if you have 3 digit rank and lets say electronics GATE was tough and electrical guys had easy GATE paper, so they have more GATE score than you, so obviously they will rank higher than electronics, then admission to VLSI will begin from that person of Electronics guy ( lets consider Ranked 300) will start filling VLSI seats. so it will be useless to judge your seat confirmation as per Rank without knowing who are above you in ranking. So though you get bigger rank, just make a survey who has guys Above you to get some guess. Better have some backups like BITS, MIT and others for safer side. Hope you get me…and may God give you desired branch. All the best for future. "

Interviewing as a college grad is much different than interviewing for a specific profile. We will try to explore how both those paths look (fresh grad and experienced). Before we explore those paths please see the following tracks that Cisco offer: There is a possibility of you getting interviewed by one of these 4 groups: IT, Engineering, Services and TAC SupportIT deals with day to day operations, customer zero, core software development etc. Job here requires you Software skills and in some cases your network skills tooEngineering deals with Cisco’s key products, more around hardware knowledge, shortest path algorithms, electronics and computer organization skills etc.Services deals with providing services to Cisco’s customers. You will be working and handling the product that Cisco has implemented for a customer. It requires knowledge on network domainTAC is Technical Assistance Center and you will be helping customer directly. It requires intensive knowledge of network and learning on the product you will be assigned toHaving said that lets explore both the paths! Fresh Graduates: You might be interviewing with one or multiple panels from one or multiple groups over multiple roundsDuring your interview you can always ask them what exactly are you interviewing about, because for fresh graduates that information isn’t explicitly called outKnowing what you are interviewing for is only for the purpose of you preparing your mind and answers accordinglyFor a fresh graduate what matters more is the way you approach a problem over finding the right solution every timeDo not go to interview with a biased mind or a focus area, be open for any opportunity that comes to you because you will get ample amount of time after getting hired to explore, learn and try it allPrepare your resume professionally and call out the key points instead of describing them endlessly. Keep it short, precise and conciseCisco also has a collaboration centre in VIT and hiring happen via that too. Do remember, Cisco recruits in VIT in multiple roundsExperienced candidates for a specific role: You will receive an invite for interview while also asking you to send over some basic casual information about yourselfThe group which is hiring for that job will send technical experts to conduct various roundsBe open for diverse requirements too"

But talking abouts taking care of your items,it also doesn't meant that in VIT you can keep anything anywhere without worries. You need to take care of your belongings, because anything can happen, even if CCTVs are present and if any sharp intruder is successful to get out of campus with valueable items, then its problem ( which is rarely observed, but need to be prepared for worse case). But pursuing such branded items in VIT is not so big issue because others too use such branded stuffs as well. So unlike other places, I can confidently say in VIT Library you can leave you branded Stuff as it is, under the trust of VIT security. For whole year me and my group did it and had that comfort.

I didn’t even know about VIT until I finished giving VITEEE. That day, I looked up some videos on YT and started judging. Honestly, this place far exceeded my expectations. I get a true feel for engineering. I realized that I wasn’t just surrounded by people who weren’t able to clear JEE (well, I did, but couldn’t get admitted to any public universities, like many of my friends here), but by students who were actually skilled at what’s in demand today. Lemme tell you one thing: Math, Physics and chemistry are all essential. There’s no dispute in that. You learn them even after you join university — in your freshman year. There are actually even more important skills you need to have, like design thinking, programming, logistics & supply chain management, etc. to become an actual engineer. Students don’t really understand the significance of skills that they actually need. VIT may not be filled with people good at doing math problems at high speeds or solving complex problems in rotational dynamics and writing organic chemical reaction mechanisms seamlessly (though there are a bunch of such people here). But I can definitely say, a lot of students here are skilled at what’s actually needed, like they make large-scale web-apps and can build robots, design complex mechanical assemblies in CAD, etc. right in their first year (of course there are societally insignificant students herein, but hey…they are everywhere). I want to make my point clear: It’s not about VIT. My peers are the reason for my inspiration. The skills they have are there even before they joined here. Many students like me, after interacting with them, realize we didn’t acquire skills relevant to the field, so we start focusing on such skills and try to be on par with other students in terms of industrial preparedness. The problem with the engineering entrance examination system in India is the subjects they test. When universities teach the same subjects why test such subjects for entrance? Why don’t they actually test the skills required for industry? As far as I understand, being able to effectively solve math, physics and chemistry questions is something that a student seeking research programs in UG should have. Nah, please don’t say it’s ‘problem solving’ and everyone needs to be perfect in it. To be frank, we don’t really need such high level of mathematical abilities, after all, at the end of the day, we all use computers for such tasks. As a human what we need is creativity and the ability to sight problems and identify the right factors that affect the solution to the problems at the first place. We need to gear up ourselves in that direction. If you’re into scientific research, then no doubt, the examination system is perfectly right, I’m talking about engineering. The students I’ve met here are good at that, and I like it. A few examples of what I’ve learnt and understood in my first year at VIT: For becoming a software engineer or simply ‘making computer software’, you don’t need to be good at organic, inorganic and physical chemistry, neither do you need to be good at mechanics. You just need to understand ‘logic’. Discrete mathematics is the only branch of math they heavily use, and some part of complex functions are used in image processing, statistics is a must for machine learning. And what do universities do? only admit top rankers in examinations into CSE branch. What’s the point in it?Coming to the branch that I major in: Mechanical Engineering. Honestly, what does everyone think? mechanical is a dead old branch of engineering. But that’s not true. Anyone who’s studied, or at least googled about a concept about ‘Industrie 4.0’ will understand why mechanical engineering is the most versatile and highly innovative one amongst all the disciplines of engineering currently in existence. For being a successful mechanical engineer, we need to be good at calculus, mechanics, materials science, operations research, design thinking, identifying problems, optimising existing mechanisms to improve efficiency, etc. Even though you need to be good at math and a bit of physics here, they’re taught at universities in the first year, so not a big concern if one is not good at that in their 12th grade, it’ll just be easy for them to understand concepts if they’re good at it. That’s all. No class in any college (including VIT), as far as I know, will be teaching about concepts like Generative design and rapid prototyping/ manufacturing techniques —which I’ve learnt about, from my classmates.I can go on explaining many things that I’ve learnt here, which many of my friends at IITs and NITs don’t know about (but they know more about science topics than I do). Maybe they’ll learn it later. VIT’s curriculum isn’t something out of Earth, just the fact that it’s FFCS, you can do any course you want, unlike other colleges(a bit similar to that of BITS Pilani but still different and more advanced). This is what I think puts VIT at a good place among other institutes at least in engineering, if not research. It’s the students here that make it a ‘place to learn, a chance to grow’. "

While pursuing designing field may help you to land in R& D sectors of manufacturing hubs and also because of your background it would be easier for you to enter into research field in that area. There could be a third option if you join IT sectors for few years, I assure you would learn a lot and few IT skills are always look good on cv additionally IT skills are like maths, everyone should know and according to surveys coding will be compulsory for all people after 10 years approx so if you are getting a chance to learn, you could go for it and after a few year you will have a certain money, exposure and a good cv to go and pursue M. S. in designing from abroad ( keeping in mind all technical Institute of India except top 3–4 are closer to be called worthless) . This path seems a lot patience but would be more fruitful I guess. Again decisions is in your hands. Just don't think only pros and cons of both ways.

Both of the institutions are very good and have their respective places. But for MCA, i would go for VIT Vellore due to the following reasons: Very good placement opportunities, thousands of companies including top MNCs visit here and you can get many chances of placing yourself for your dream job.The exposure is very good. It's really very nice, you get to see many things that you wouldn't have expected before.Hostel facilities is remarkable.Latest technologies and facilities are used here, u don't need to look up to any other source for anything extra you want to learn.College fests of VIT Vellore is better than BIT Mesra.Varieties of food courts, canteens, DC where you can get almost everything you crave for till midnight.Other facilities like sports, swimming pool, gymnasium, etcs are there and all fully maintained.Library here is one of the best libraries you would see, with a variety of books, novels etc.Overall every infrastructure in VIT is better.P.S.: Though you get all these things here in VIT, sometimes it gets very tough for northies to stay here without feeling suffocated. A lot of restrictions are there.. you have to give a huge fine for almost every mischief that you do even if it's very normal there in north. Many things you will find when you get to see it, i cannot write every detail as there's a lot to mention. And be prepared for a lot of tasks and assignments, they'll keep you extremely busy for those 2 years you spend here. If you are thinking of joining BIT Mesra, i would suggest you to go only for main campus (Mesra campus), any other is not worth of the huge amount that they demand. Placements are also not good there. "

I repeat, Do not do it. I'm saying this due to many reasons. First of all, the immediate effect you'll have is that you won't get any time for anything. Your time-table will be a complete mess. There is a reason why VIT has thought of keeping one half for theory and other half for labs. Generally, most of your classes will be in the same academic building but that's not the case for labs. Speaking from my personal experience, in 2nd semester my Chemistry theory class was in SJT whereas its lab was in SMV. Now, just imagine your lab gets over and you have to run for a theory class in SJT.Second and worst part of this, exams. In VIT, your exam schedule is entirely based on your slots. During CATs, exams happen in two shifts, one mornings and one afternoon, and these slots shuffle after CAT 1. For example, in CAT 1, A1 slot students will have their exam in morning and A2 slot students will have their exams in the evening. This order will change in CAT 2. A2 students will have their exams in the morning and so on. So, the point here is that, if you take mixed slots (A1 and A2) then you'll have two CAT exams on the same day. Regarding FAT, you won't have same day examinations but you'll have them everyday. So, today you'll have A1 and then the very next day you'll have A2. It would be really difficult to handle (Speaking this from my personal experience, in 3rd semester, I had A1, A2 and B1 slots. I had two spend sleepless nights to study for exams, still wasn't able to complete 100% of the syllabus).P.S. But still, many people tend to take mixed slots and ultimately it boils down to your own personal preferences. "

Yes ofcourse. Considering the adverse situation every exam is getting postponed. So exams like BITSAT and VITEEE are also very likely to get postponed. Another reason is that these are national level exams and the situation in every state is very different from each other.

Checking this is vital, as it speaks more about the university than the university does.Government/Private University: It is advised to compare the pros and cons of either type of university, with emphasis on the modus operandi of either type.Class Size: It is often said that having a smaller teacher to student ratio is a win-win for both teachers and students, so that is something you might want to look up at.Quality of Education/Faculty/Campus Resources: This is probably the most vital point of comparison. You would obviously want to look up for the quality of education, faculty, and campus resources offered before you invest four years of your time into any university.Social Life: Social life is something every college fresher looks up to. In the beginning, this might sound very petty, but it is those fests and events that help you socialize with more people and make new friends. Hence, one needs to analyze which institutes could provide you with a better social life.Tuition/Financial Aid/RoI: For what its worth, it is vital to compare and select institutes that might be feasible for you. Those with a more reasonable Return of Investment (RoI), which also provide adequate scholarships and waivers.Location: Being close to home is something every student longs for. Hence, you might want to check up which university is closer to you in terms of distance.Course Catalogue: Looking up the course catalog would help you develop an understanding as to know what you can expect to learn from an academic perspective.Wishing you luck, and if you have decided on joining, we look forward to welcoming you at Anna University!

I being from ECM had the opportunity to take a few of them . Say in Data Structures and Algorithms (CSE2003/ECM1002) you’ll use a lot of C++ and sometimes Python3 (depending upon the professor ) In Database Management Systems you’ll use SQL (MySQL/OracleSQL/Postgres) again depending on your professor. My professor taught us OracleSQL stating that it’s generally used in the industry though I am yet to find out. In Web of Things (ECM1004) we tinkered with a lot of NodeJS and learned to create and handle different API’s . It’s a fun subject . In Computer Graphics and Multimedia(CSE3016) we were taught OpenGL that’s written in C++ so you learn the C++ graphics framework at the same time you are allowed to tinker a lot with any other language that supports graphics. (Python3 becomes the second best choice ) CSE also has a lot of other electives like Game Programming(CSE3029) , Mobile Programming (CSE4027) , Web Mining (CSE3024) (.. yes you can smell the selenium :p) So you’ll have a great learning opportunity , spend time on whatever domain that interests you.

Company 2: Then comes Cognizant in April end(CTC 3.4LPA), appeared in exam from home and shortlisted students were called to VIT Chennai campus in May'18. 1 technical round and q HR round, both of them being rejection round, they announced results after 10 days with offers for around 45 students which I was also part of. More offers were rolled out after 1 month in which i guess 50 students might've been selected. Company 3: Then comes the Deloitte in late December'18(CTC 5LPA). In few batches, I believe close to 10–15 people might've been rolled out offer. (I, too got offer but couldn't joun because of Notice period in my current company, as Deloitte wanted to hire me as a fresher and they didn't give relaxation in joining date.) Company 4: Then again comes ZS(CTC 5.5-6.5LPA), IN January'19, they'll provide Flight bookings from whichever cuty you're in, but they'll select 1 out of 40 people they've called. I got rejected in final round. And someone from IIT was selected. So my suggestion is, don't be disappointed. In January'20, VIT-PAT planned lateral hiring for graduated students. Even now in June'20 VIT-PAT has started lateral hiring due to COVID-19 situation. Cheers, CSE Under grad of '18 batch. "

May be the only parameter that takes the ranking up above BITS.. But overall there is no comparison at all between these two colleges. One difference is BITS only have sharper minds whereas VIT have all types of students. VIT gives opportunities to everyone and almost all CS, ECE, IT students get placed in reputed companies. May be due to the fact that having more number of students and having good amount of research publications every year and seeing the fact that VITs placement has also improved over years the ranking is above BITS. Intially back in 2013–16 average package used to be 3–3.5 lakhs pa and now in 2020 it has increased to 6.5–7 lakhs pa. BITS, IIITH are the least preferred colleges by NIRF as already told in previous answers. But the reality is both are 10 times better than the colleges above it (excluding top IITs) including VIT, SRM and other private colleges. But to conclude VIT is also a good college for only CS and IT and soon in coming 4 to 5 years it will excel more for sure. Every year they try to adapt to modern things and changes the curriculum as per industry needs (ONLY CS and IT department). They really need to work in core department as they lack in providing core placements (EE, EC, Mech, Civil). But BITS provide ample of core placements especially in Electrical and Electronics department. They have something called as “Practice School (PS)”. If you are not placed you will be in PS and will do internship with top notch companies which ensures you will get placement sooner or later. Hope it helps! "

But here are some points i would like to mention: I know that BITS, IIIT hyderabad, and many IITs and NITs are the colleges everyone aspire to study in. But the rankings are based on many factors. Everybody is believing that because intelligent minds are going in IITs and NITs, their college rank should be better. But thats not how this ranking works. There are many aspects, one of them i would like to mention is the number of research papers published. I myself published two research papers in final year and VIT is in top5 in research paper publications in the country.I too wanted to study in IITs and NITs( who doesnt want to), but due to reservation and my fault of not preparing well i could not get into one. When i came to VIT, i thought there wont be much intelligent minds here. But i was wrong, there were many people who had a lot of potential, but they did not realise it when they were preparing for entrance exams and most of them are from general category. They worked hard in the 4 years and finally placed with a high salary package. The average package for CSE in VIT is around 8–9lpa(This is the average for 1000 students, 20% students even got more than 20lpa) Around 30 students got more than 40lpa overall including other branches.I started coding 1 year before placement and i too got placed with a decent package which I never thought as i did not have much coding experience and i am not from CSE branch. So, if you work hard, your hard work will not go in vain. Everyone wants to get a decent starting package to boost their career after engineering and the college placement statistics gave me a belief, that’s why i took the risk of starting coding. Had the college placement statisics been poor, i would have never started coding. I have seen many students doing their btech from a local college and getting a huge package by applying for off-campus placements. Why would a company hire someone if the person is not talented and is not fit for the role in the comapany.So, no college is bad. If someone is studying in some xyz college which is not IIT, NIT or BITS, it doesn’t mean that they cannot progress in their life. There are many average students in VIT. But they work hard, the college in very strict in terms of academics. Our marks reports are sent to our parents after every semester. They have made such rules and guidelines that makes even an average student to realise its potential and talent. I have seen many average students like me and also the change in their personality after 4 years. I am saying these facts because many people dont know these facts and they are demeaning other colleges after the NIRF ranking has been released.And its not just VIT , I think the other colleges who recieved good ranks also take many efforts to increase their overall performance. So appreciate the hardwork , rather than sitting and commenting about something without knowing the reality.Obviously IITs, BITs and NITs are better than these private colleges in terms of academics. But these rankings are based on other factors as well. I am seeing that students of good colleges considering the NIRF as scam. But what is the use of it. It is the duty of government to publish these results and not ours. As a student, our duty is to study and work hard. But everyone is trying to degrade other colleges saying that they don’t deserve to be there. I m not able to see the benefit of it. I would have had no problem if my college rank were poor. I am happy that i learned a lot and achieved something in my life and that’s what matters in the end. "

Of papers published, quality of those publication, patent granted & govt or corporate projects done. Here BITS score 34.87 while VIT scored 64.. Clearly the research carried out in VIT is huge & VIT is ahead by large margin.Graduation Outcome: No. of Doctoral Students passing out & Research scholar enrolling.. BITS score 77 while VIT scored 63.. So again BITS wonOutreach & Inclusivity: No. of students coming from different economic background, different states, different countries.. Also no. of Male: Female students, No. Of students with physical disabilities.. Here VIT scored 58 & BITS scored 56. So VIT ahead by slight margin.Peer Perception: Perception of other educational institutions towards your institution as well as perception of corporate companies hiring.. Here VIT scored 46 where as BITS scored 42.. this is probably because higher research output VIT is having slightly better perception among academic world.Now you can clearly see VIT has achieved this rank because of higher research output. And BITS did better in Teaching Learning or even placement.. So unlike us, govt don't judge Institute based on placement alone.. infact they give more priority to research.. Now whether it's right or wrong is subjective but looking at it I think people can take informed decision based on one's own priority.. Hope this helps "

I was never aspiring for IITs, I was from small town and coaching institutes here are not that good and I was not allowed by my parents to go to Kota for coaching. My sole aim was to get BITS(any campus) or top NITs or IIITs. I was getting NIT Patna EEE in the 7th round of JOSAA. I also appeared for VITEEE and got a rank of 2.3K. I don't know if that was sufficient for getting CSE at Vellore campus or not as I did not apply for its councelling. I scored 272 marks in BITSAT. I applied for councelling. I was getting MSc. Bio in Pilani campus. Although I was not aware of dual degree program of BITS but after consulting with seniors I made my mind to take admission at BITS. After coming to college I was surprised by the environment. Students were pretty serious about their future. They were not only focusing on grades but also involved in many kind of development activities. Some of them were involved in competitive coding, application development and web development from first year itself. Some of them had started preparation for UPSC and other competitive exams. Many of them wanted to pursue higher education from foreign universities. Many students were involved in different kinds of sports. Almost all of the students were into some kind of club or department. I don't know about the quality of students at VIT but I can safely say that the quality of students at any campus of BITS is very high. Regarding infrastructure and facilities, I can surely say that it is one of the best according to me. Our hostels, lecture halls, academic building, library are fully equipped with high speed internet. Students get 5GB data per day. Although we can access unlimited fast internet at IPC labs which are open till midnight. Professors here are good. I will not say great except few. They are very interactive. In hostels, there is no curfew timing. You can roam around the campus even at 2 A.M. Mess food is good. Hostel rooms are also fully equipped. Regarding placements it is better to say nothing. Anyday placement at any campus of BITS is much much better than VIT Vellore. Regarding research I don't know much about it. Getting into VIT is very easy. One of my classmates at my coaching had scored just 26 percentile in JEE Mains and is now student of Mechanical Engineering at VIT Vellore Campus. Although I am not generalizing this point for every student at VIT. The only negative factor at BITS is its high fee. Deep down inside we all know that if every student at VIT is given a chance to join BITS they will surely join BITS. Although many of them will not accept it on Quora. I don't know how much fair is the NIRF ranking but I can safely say that if it is fair with not bribery involved then it's a matter of time for BITS to overtake VIT. . "

Hence,never choose a college solely on rankings.Rankings can be misleading as I just mentioned.Do, research yourself and check for factors like placements, alumni network,brand etc. "

Well , this completely depends on what was your performance in your Internship. You can score good grade(S or A) easily if you have performed well during your internship training period . Here are some important suggestions , which you can follow if you want ot score good grade by doing final year internship instead of a project . There are majorly 2 ways of Evaluation in this case→ 1)Company manager , under whom you have worked will send feedback to VIT Placement Team. The most important parameters in this case are→ Ability to articulate the problem and identify objectives Ability to demonstrate the right use of technology to achieve the identified objectives Ability to identify and compare related technologies taht can be used to realise the identified objectives Ability to self-evaluate and learn from mistakes Ability to use the basics of science to explain the engineering / design principles and the technology used Quality of the draft project report Abiding to the format while making project reports Submission within the due date Continuous engagement in learning and work ethics 2)Sometime company may not send the feedback , then based on the projects what you have done , evaluation will be done by VIT Faculties (PAT will arrange the panel , no need to worry about that) In this case the most important parameters are→ 1)Explanation skills 2)Project demonstration (You must take care of the fact that , during presentation , you should not tell any the company confidential information) 3)Questions asked by faculty(Like : How you can relate this project with your B.Tech domain , What is the future work and some questions based on your project etc) A proper conclusion & result plays the most important role in this case. Follow the rules & guidelines of VIT strictly , to make the PPT and Report. Hope it will help you . Thank You . Best wishes and good luck always :-) "

You can visit to websites of both or can visit to campus.Lovely Professional University is best University in terms of Academics,Placements,International exposure,Ranking etc. I have done graduation and post graduation from this university and my experience was splendid. LPU is helping me grow professionally and personally with its career-oriented programs and support. I would like to share few points here:- The faculty members are very knowledgeable in their respective fields. They are always ready to help the students . During the exams, professors arrange special classes for the students to help them revise better and clear their doubts. Frequent guest lectures/ workshops are also organized for them by the university. , Ministry of Science Technology’s Advisory Monitoring Committee Meeting was held where 42 Scientists from various top universities like IITs, NITs, top Central and State Universities including (LPU) from across the country presented their research proposals. Apart from this, LPU has best lab facilities for each subject. Department has a dedicated laboratory division with fully functional world-class equipment. A large library spread over 6 floors, with lakhs of books and resources. You can read and issue books on the weekly basis. Also, in my view, I think you should not worry about the placements. If you work hard in the course and learn as much as you can, any company visiting the campus would be happy to hire you. However, you must not neglect polishing your communication skills as well, because companies will check that in their interviews. LPU provides plenty of opportunities to its students to take part in events, competitions, fests in order to let them grow their personality and give them a chance to polish their skills. The most important is the university placements which are quite decent as far as I can tell. Well-known companies including MNC’s visit the campus for the recruitment. Till now, Cognizant is the biggest recruiter. It has a record of placing 600+ students in a day. Now let’s talk about the activities. There are a number of activities conducted at LPU throughout the year. Various sports are structured. You can participate or play any sport according to their choice basketball, hockey, cricket, table tennis, volleyball etc. Talking about campus,The first time I visited the campus I had no idea how big the campus would be, I wasn’t prepared to witness such a huge walk down but later got used to it. I would say be prepared to witness muscle pain in initial few days if you are not used to physical exercise on regular bases. It provides all the facilities inside campus, let it be from restaurants, eateries, grooming facilities, ATMs, bowling alley, hospital, banks, and post-offices,Hospitals are available. LPU has it’s own 8 storey mall which has shops for literally everything including gadgets and a departmental store like WH SMITH LPU's infrastructure is one of the biggest & best in the World. Thanks! "

Not only about placement but the course circullum is quite updated.. University aggressively try to organise corporate talks, seminars, intercollege design competition (makeathon).. infact for each subject you are being taught one module by some industry person.. the labs are having all the industry standard tools hence students face no problems going to the industry..The college push students to do multiple projects along with their regular course work.. So to summarize, if you don't get old IITs, top 3 southern NITs, BITS Pilani, VIT is a great choice to do MTech VLSI from..If you work hard, VIT VLSI can easily give a package more than 10lpa..

You can extract as much as you can from what VIT provides and still be left with some things to do. Some of my friends are placed in Bajaj, Schumbulger, Hero Moto Corp, Honda, Tata Motors, Mahindra, Tata Technologies and other core companies. Also, those who lack in studies and other co-curricular and extra-curricular activities do get placed in other CS IT companies and so have got more than 10LPA package too.

I can tell you this VIT is going to become one of the TOP ranked universities of the World in at least Engineering and Bio-Sciences in the near future.

But if you are not a GENERAL category student and are a SC ST or OBC student then you can easily get a good score in GATE and can get a good IIT or NIT, then choose that only. In India , IITs NITs discriminate on the basis of caste and creed, when people want to work for India and do research for India. IITs NITs discriminate against people on the basis of their Caste Creed and age.

Let me still give it a shot! Needless to say, the CSE program at VIT (all campuses) has been historically competitive and categories 1 and 2 are definitely the most sought after by students because of the fee structure. From my experience, it is not the number of years you spend preparing for the exam that gets you the seat as much as the amount of time spent that actually contributes to your performance in the exam. This is Smart Work vs Hard Work . For example, spending 10 years to prepare for the VITEE exam puts you at a potential risk of a syllabus revision or a change in the exam pattern. In 10 years, the syllabus could likely change, seeing that the exam syllabus is influenced by the 11 & 12th syllabi which goes through revision from time to time. So, you are then at a risk of losing all the years you spend studying the old pattern all while they make a change to it. I am not saying it will happen but that’s a possibility that I would have in consideration before I decide to spend a whole decade preparing for an entrance exam. Alternatively, an ideal time would be 2–3 years of heavy lifting that includes understanding the exam structure, speaking with past students and alumni about their experience with 1st and 2nd category counselling for CSE and of course hours of actual study. See, the cut-off rank changes every year as Number of applicants changeNumber of seats available changeNumber of students who actually attend counselling after they score the ranks changeOther management factors changeSo, do not focus on the rank cutoff as it is not controllable but what you can control is you and how you study. Do not count the number of years but the number of hours you spend actually studying and practicing model questions thereby improving your test taking skills. My suggestion is set an ideal timeline, be organized and you can expect to have about 2–3 years of time for your preparation. Cheers and good luck! "

We can expect good campus placement as they show off?,0,1,0/1,No,Requested,2020-05-06,https://www.quora.com/Hello-sir-Is-a-BTech-mechanical-is-worth-in-VIT-We-can-expect-good-campus-placement-as-they-show-off,"Disclaimer:- The below answer is based on the placement scenario of the 2019 batch. The answer depends on what you seek at the end of your graduation. If you want to pursue higher studies after your graduation like Masters in Engineering or Management from abroad, then VIT is a decent choice as it can give you a good platform to carry out research in your field of interest.If you want a core job, then you will need to work extremely hard to be able to secure a decent offer. If you are able to maintain a decent CGPA (8.5+ preferably) and gain some useful skills, then most probably you will land up in a core company. But again, the no. of companies visiting the VIT campus is a function of the market scenario during that time. But still, VIT attracts a good number of companies because of its brand value.Apart from core companies, a lot of consulting, IT, and analytics firms visit the campus. Although it is easy to bag a mass placement offer (TCS/Infosys/Cognizant), one must have a high CGPA and solid programming knowledge to get into product-based IT companies especially when they belong to circuit branches(Mechanical, Civil,etc.)All in all, the placement scenario is decent and one can get a dream offer with persistent efforts in the right direction.

As some of my friends in the 5 year integrated biotechnology course have suggested that they have pretty much extra subjects to study which makes it a bit hectic. Also they used to have classes on Saturdays to complete their portion in time which also was hectic. This is a 5 year course so you spend a lot time on the college which makes you feel very bad if you once starts to hate the course. So it all depends on the individual. you will get better opportunities in the course after you complete PhD that too if possible from abroad. one of my friends in your who did the same course in VIT move abroad for doing his PhD as now he is settled in Germany with a very good package.

I did not even try to see what those rankings are for a very simple reason. I look at the source of those rankings, I see its the MHRD, a government organisation. Now I am aware of the general hatred and dissent among the government regarding BITS Pilani. To keep it short and simple, BITS and the government do not see eye to eye. BITS Pilani is like your ‘bad’ child that you want to disown- because he grew up without your love and care, burning in the Sun (quite literally, damn Pilani heat!) to be a strong independent individual, thriving as good as or even better than some of your other kids who grew up under your warm shadow. Now you have to remember no matter what, you will always favour your ‘other’ kids. Especially since the black diamond (I do not want to call my college bad child again and again) still does not listen to you, and thrives by his own rules. Every couple of years, we get to hear stories that UGC has put something or other on hold, sent a notice to BITS regarding this or that. That is how it is. Then there is another factor, which is built into the core of India, corruption. Now I am not saying that XYZ bribed them while MNO did not, but it is fairly certain that one of the institutions here has a history of not giving a damn about politics and such rankings on a broader viewpoint, while the other desperately strategises for it (which is in no way to offend anyone- it’s just good promotion). Bottom line: If you are up for a super environment, where each person has reached by his own hard work and not because his great^1–25 grandparents were treated like shit by some shittier people(cough-: reservation), and you want to be challenged- challenged to get sponsors for your annual fest, eat challenging food, create challenging time table, and get selected through a challenging exam, (I mean okay, I promised not to say anything bad about other colleges but what’s the point of having an examination that only has syllabus till 11th duh? it’s like saying f you, you studied last one year for nothing dog!) then BITS Pilani is for you! Rest is just to instigate an endless inconclusive spat between the students and alumni of two good institutions, named BITS and VIT. And about BITS, in the end, It’s Magic… People: please feel free to comment with good justifiable arguments, any trash talk about either institution will be reported!

They go more in depth of subjects like microprocessors but anyway you can opt for them in electives if they interest you.Rest is all similar. Placements wise I've heard that most of the companies allow students from CSE with spec in Bioinformatics to sit for companies that other CSE students are sitting for.A few hardware companies may not allow you though. Overall placement wise it's a good branch to be in and you'll have placements scenario similar to that of CSE and IT students.

1344,Vellore-Institute-of-Technology-Vellore,What are some good places to live in Vellore?,1,1,1/1,No,Followed,2020-04-21,https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-good-places-to-live-in-Vellore,"Vellore, the Fort City, is about 130 KMs away from Chennai and about 200 Kms away from Bengaluru. It is served by NH 48 which runs East to West and NH 234. Both Highways bisect the City and intersect at the so-called Green Circle. It is actually a twin-city under one Corporation, viz., Vellore and Katpadi. The twin cities fall under two different Assembly segments and two different Parliamentary constituencies. River Palar runs through the City, but now it mostly remains dry as the Karnataka and AP Governments have erected a lot of check-dams across the River. Vellore is a City steeped in the history of Middle Chola, Medieval Vijayanaragara, the late Mogul and the Maratta dynasties. In the last days of the East India Company, a British garrison was stationed within the ramparts of the Fort. The first shot of Indian War of Independence in 1857 was fired at Vellore. It is quiet City with few law and order issues. The population is fairly well-educated; and there are a number of good educational institutions catering to the needs of the pupils. The heavy traffic flow and the traffic mismanagement pose a major problem for the inhabitants. The local population comprises of Hindus, Muslims and Christians, who live cheek by jowl. Communal issues were a thing of past. But recently the City witnessed the shocking and unprovoked murders of two prominent BJP personalities by two extremists. But to the credit of the Govt, they apprehended the accused and chargesheeted them. The Govt took all the required steps to assuage the tempers of the affected group from flaring up. It has a dry climate which is extremely scorching in summer and cold in the winter. The AIADMK Govt headed by PT Amma, Dr. J. Jayalalithaa, resolved the drinking water crisis that the Velloreans were accustomed to suffering in the scorching summers. Thanks to her, the City is served with the wasters of the Cauvery River. There are three major institutions, the religious, the medical and the educational interests of the inhabitants and the visitors that occupy the pride of place in the City. A small airport is up and coming. The VIT University is in the North-East direction, the CMC Hospital and the Fortis Hospital are right in the centre of the City and the Golden Temple is in the South West direction. The CMC Hospital is bringing up a Multi-Specialty Hospital on the edge of the City abutting NH 48. If you are visiting Vellore as a medical tourist, it is better to stay in and around Thottapalayam, Saidapet or Kakithapattarai or Sathuvachari, where you can rent a premise, either single tenement or a large residential apartment, as these places are close to CMC and Fortis Hospitals. A visitor to the City for the religious purpose of visiting Golden Temple may choose to reside in Ariyur in the vicinity of the Temple. A visitor, who wishes to pay a visit to the VIT University may choose his accommodation in Gandhi Nagar or Katpadi. If someone wants to settle down in the City, he may either choose Gandhi Nagar or Sathuvachari as the roads are broad and population is a little sparse. "

I don't think it was an aim to begin with. I had always aimed for something above 9 to begin with. But then, when the 1st semester results came out, I realized that something like this may be possible. I think three primary things helped me achieve this. A strong peer group - VIT is a college where the onus is on you to seek out and form your own groups. Due to the large batch sizes, it's up to you to seek out people with similar interests and motivations. I think I was pretty lucky in that respect. I am proud to have formed some very strong friendships, friends I could discuss notes with, solve problems, and also do some amazing projects. Nearly everyone I know is super succesful now, either pursuing higher education in premier educational institutes, running their own businesses or working in top companies.Dedicated study routine - This is critical. An engineering course will never require you to study everyday but it's critical that you spend some time at the end of every week to just think and summarize every thing that you have picked up over the course of the week. You can either revise everything spending an hour every day or a few hours at the end of each week. I think this works very well to form your own understanding of the concepts. This makes it easier before exams when you don't have to pull all nighters to just cram everything up. This also makes it possible to do the stuff you like. I was a Student Council member, also a member of the University football team where we won 15+ trophies in our 4 years. I was also the Vice captain of the team in my final year. So yes, a proper routine helps you remain organized and also make time for the things you love.Zero attendance policy - This, in my opinion is the best rule put in place by the institute. Students having a CGPA > 9.0 are allowed to maintain zero attendance. This allowed me to only attend the courses which I loved, allowing to me efficiently deploy my time elsewhere, doing things I loved or was passionate towards. I would take all the notes of the other courses, and gain a thorough understanding post discussion with my peers. In fact, the study material (books and slides) were enough to gain an in depth understanding of concepts to ace the examinations.Well, I hope this answers your question. Please feel free to reach out for any specific doubts. All the best! "

Company hires & put them in various roles as per their need.. many grads are put into Verification, RTL Design, Physical Design, CAD, DFT, CV.. I was interested in Analog Circuit Design so I myself got into Analog.. Max salary varies each year.. in 2017, when I sat for placement the highest salary was offered by Texas Instruments (18lpa)..

If your rank is around 300 you might get a seat in CSE either in Vellore or Chennai. U can select your interested branch, department on your own if you are inside the eligibility criteria.

For example if you get a rank of say 5000 and you want cs for btech from vit you can go for the allotment and if your rank doesn't get you a seat in vit vellore you can take the chennai (even though both are equally good). Usually vellore gets filled first.

So, expecting such question for private collage is not unexpected. See, I was also in same sitaution regarding reputation of vit when I was about to join the collage. But after entering collage i realised that money my parents invested is not going to get wasted because in VIT you can feel you are living in home. Life in VIT is nice as it seems to be in google images exact replica of landscape shown in google pictures. Student life is amazing with ample of opportunities to develop yourself and explore your inner site if you are still in nutshell of being shy and attached with home. Now, coming to main point Reputation you can ask any knowledgeable person or even in MHRD rankings VIT is one of the highly recognized collages just like IITS and even above some of them. So, don’t leave any chance to grab opportunity in VIT. But if you are getting a good government collage with your branch preference only then consider your decision of opting another collage, Not just you are getting your branch preference in VIT then also you are leaving VIT considering it is private collage don’t make that mistake at that moment just check your budget and then take decision wisely if you feel your parents can’t send you there then just leave about taking admission here. Hope it helps and clear your doubts a little. "

Though the definition of “the best” may vary person to person, it’s safe to make assertions based on numbers, outreach, and influence. Clubs like Entrepreneurship Cell (E-Cell), Centre for Social Entrepreneurship and Development (CSED), and Dream Merchants aim at helping students to become entrepreneurs. However, there are certain things about E-Cell which gives it an edge above others. E-Cell VIT is in collaboration with VIT Technology Business Incubator (VITTBI) which has incubated more than 30 start-ups by students. VITTBI gets upto ₹1 crore grant from the Government of India every year to make sure every great project gets where it deserves to be. E-Cell VIT organizes E-Summit every year, which is the biggest entrepreneurial fest in South India. Under E-Summit banner, it holds events like: Start-up Internship Expo where start-ups from numerous domains come to the campus and hire interns.E-Talk, where acclaimed and influential management executives from corporates give their advice to partakers.Networking Dinner, where participants get to have conversation over dinner with eminent guests and company owners.Start-up VIT, where budding start-ups compete to get funded by VITTBI.And many more. Other events include: HackerTech, a 36-hour hackathon with esteemed mentors and judges to help participants in weaving their ideas into money-making real-life businesses.Entrepreneurship Awareness Camp, which is an interactive session where influential business owners share their valuable experiences and advice with the participants.Furthermore, they have Udaan (Real World Business Simulation), Business and Beyond sessions, and Face2Face (Podcast). Public relations, and collaborations with other College Entrepreneurship Cells like IIIT-D, BITS Pilani, Hyderabad Campus, Sastra University, Loyola College and, a huge network of entrepreneurs put it in a league of its own.

Now I don't know how many credits is your course. If there is a lab or a project component then the weightage of your theory marks reduces in your final score calculation. If the subject is only theory then don't worry there is still hope. Both cat 1 and cat 2 are of 50 marks which get condensed down to 15 marks each. Then we have 30 marks which is split into the Digital assignments and quizzes. So now 30+15+15 = Continue ReadingWell if you have got debarred in cat 1 and cat 2 due to low attendace then make sure you have the sufficient attendace to be eligible to write the Final assesmet test or as we call it FAT. Now I don't know how many credits is your course. If there is a lab or a project component then the weightage of your theory marks reduces in your final score calculation. If the subject is only theory then don't worry there is still hope. Both cat 1 and cat 2 are of 50 marks which get condensed down to 15 marks each. Then we have 30 marks which is split into the Digital assignments and quizzes. So now 30+15+15 = 60. These 60 marks are our internal marks and the rest 40 is external. That is the 100 marks final paper gets condensed to 40. Now to pass your final score including external and internal should be more than 50 assuming that this a only theory course. Again Assuming that you get 25/30 in your assignments and quizzes you need 63/100 in the final exam to pass the subject but with a very bad grade probably an E. But if your course has a project or lab component then your entire theory component (internal +external) gets reduced to 75 and the rest 25 are from lab or project which is actually of 100 marks but gets condensed to 25. Therefore final score = 75(theory) +25(lab/project) Again assuming your final lab score out of 100 is 85 Internal assesments and quizzes is 25/30 you would need only 40 marks in the final exam to pass the subject. Again with a bad grade tho. So don't lose hope and ace your FAT. Hope this helps :)

So this is the marks distribution which in final sums upto give you a grade from S,A,B,C,D,F,N Cat-1=15%(marks you score out of 50) Cat-2=15%(marks you score out of 50) 3assignmnt=added as it is Fat=40%(marks you score out of 100) This over all totl must be more than 40 So in your case if u have decent marks in assgnmnt out of 30 and score good in fat ypu can score easliy above aggregate 40. Apart from this its better to do some calculation before attending fat. "

Now, coming back to your query, one of my cousin is studying in LPU and they are the largest private university in North India with a vast number of students from all across the nation and even there are some foreign students, as well. They even offer workshops related to the IT sector which are of short period and students can join those at a very nominal fee, compared to outer agencies. It will not affect the regular studies of the students as most of them are scheduled after their class timings and even on Saturday and Sundays.

Well I get admitted in VIT with high ambitions in 2008 but I couldn't manage my health throughout my college so my studies.Though I tried working hard but my studies were affected badly due to health issues. I somehow managed to get a job but I couldn't continue my job as my health was getting worse.When I left the job I went in depression.I became careless and started ignoring things related to my career.It went on till 3 years after graduating and after that I became little serious about my career. I joined the job but I suffered a lot due to my poor skills and poor health. Till now I am not settled well but I have taken my health seriously and I am working to make it better.I have improved my health and quality of life significantly and I am hopeful for my bright future.

The marks awarded in Indian engineering colleges for internships/industrial training is about 10 marks. Like the marks awarded for submitting assignments is 10 marks. So, if any Indian engineering student does not pursue an internship or industrial training in India then he shall not be awarded those 10 marks and that much marks would be deducted from his final score. Nothing much would happen. You would get the degree. You would get to appear in the campus placement. What is the problem if I do not get an tech internships during my engineering program, and I just produce an industrial training certificate at my Indian engineering college ? Nothing. You shall be able to get the marks that are given for pursuing industrial training at your college and if you do not do any industrial training then you shall not be given those 10 marks in your final marksheet. You shall be able to apply for any Indian job in India even without pursuing any Indian Industrial Training during your Indian engineering program, just on the basis of your engineering degree. But if you hone your computer programming skills and you are able to improve your github profile(thereby getting a tech internship !) then you shall be considered as an skilled employee by various international software engineering companies and you shall be called for employment purpose throughout the world.You will pay to pursue an industrial training.A tech company would pay you to pursue a tech internship.Since India is not any industrialised country, hence there is NO culture of internships in India.

No match, since it is pure based on JEE rank and no quota of any kind, pure merit. You would require tentatively above 98%tile (-+0.3%tile) for CSE in LNMIIT, since cut off for CSE and CCE in LNMIIT are very high. So decide according to your %tile in JEE 2020.

The financial help – scholarships In reputed institutes like IITs, not only the fee is less, the government runs various scholarship programs for needy students. The college fee never becomes a burden on students and parents. Job security is one of the top benefit. A chance to be taught by the best professors IIT professors are brilliant researchers who give space and opportunity to young students to excel in many different fields. An opportunity to meet and study with brilliant minds In an institute like IIT, you will study with some of the brilliant students sharing valuable knowledge and experience with each other. According to Sunil Kumar from IIT Guwahati – “In IIT, you will learn more from your peers than the teachers!” Internships in some of the best universities around the globe With programs like students exchange, you can study or do research work in a reputed foreign university. You will get opportunities for better internships and projects than anywhere else. Mentors and Alumni Support The students who pass-out from IITs and other reputed institutes act as mentors for juniors. If a student has an interesting idea, a business model, building a product, etc., then the alumni group support these things through funding and sponsorship. Advantage of studying in VITS: PLACEMENTS: good for placements compared to other private universities like srm but not bits(if you work hard). ENDLESS BRANCHES: Lots of specialization branches related to some latest technologies & also in computer science. ex:- Machine learning, information security, Artificial intelligence, etc. ETHNICITY: The campus is nice with a mix-up of different culture as people from all over India are here. INFRASTRUCTURE: The lab & faculty are very good. FFCS: {fully flexible credit system}( it helps you to choose your slot ,time and faculty for subjects) it is good but of course it has some cons also. Mess food & Paid Night canteen: available (10pm–12:30 am) those who loves to enjoy whole night. Centralized Ac rooms : available, but off-course they are expensive . Lots of chapters and clubs. "

Q has the best rooms hands down. But it feels like you are living in an apartment and not a hostel. 3. Foodcy is the best mess to dine. All the mess facilities of them are great. D annex, food park and the other mess facilities provided are great. Now back to your question, every year the intake increases in VIT Vellore. Also, the room allotment depends on your GPA.

So I can't comment on going or against going to VIT in specific. But it would be wise to drop one more year instead of joining some institute in haste. Do your research, weigh your options and come to a conclusion. No doubt, IITs are much superior in brand value compared to VIT. If you have scored a good enough rank, you might have to think about NITs and RA courses in IITs too. As IITs have great recognition through out the world, it would be a value addition to your resume if you wish to pursue PhD outside or in India and I believe it adds weight to your resume in whatever career you choose. Flipside, if VIT has a good placement record and you don't have any plans for PhD or so, enquire about how good the institute is through the alumni and take a decision. It's a different story that irrespective of which institute you are from, you have to prove your credibility consistently, inorder to be ahead in the race. "
