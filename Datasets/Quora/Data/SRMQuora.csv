Yes they'll pay their Semester fee and take admission but if they wish to leave the college they will be refunded with some percentage of the original amount. So it's not wise to think the competition will decrease however , I think many students might have prepared well enough in lockdown to increase their scores. Give your best , carpe diem. "

Yes, it is worthy to learn engineering nowadays as well as in the future. The demand for engineers will be always high. But, you might be thinking, then why many are students after graduating from Engineering colleges are unemployed nowadays. Worthy to read this-When a student freshly graduates in Engineering major, many things play a crucial role, which decides whether he will be called unemployed or employed. Like the dream job, the mentor, the other plans, the govt exams, the salary, the references, the accommodation, the environment, the city. Many out there have these things missing in them, which interrupt their whole course to join a company. Important in these are mentor, References, Dream job, And City. Either you have to make a balance between them or to sacrifice on to compensate other irrespective of an important one.  Do the extremely hard work and Talent payback? What’s a good example other than class toppers of every Engineering course. They are extremely hardworking persons, good in everything(assuming), so you might be thinking that what will go wrong with them right?. Just snatch reference, dream job, and campus placement from them and you will see them right next to you in a BPO job. Note this-Obviously, if you are talented and in a suitable place, where your talent is cared then yes, your talent will pay you 100 fold. But if you are honing your talent irrespective of any extra holds then maybe you will not get what you want. A prime example is- A part-time athlete, singer, artist from a good place with their part-time hobbies have a good chance to pursue their part-time dream but a person with a single dream from not so good place will face many problems before time. It’s because of a lack of exposure to the vast opportunity which can be seen from these examples. Worthy to read this- I have seen many friends of mine as well as many others who were too good in everything, I mean it. But they end up in not so likely jobs, which they never wanted or dreamt of. What goes wrong?, well as I say before, either you have to make a balance between things which you like or you have to sacrifice one for others. If you can't do one of them, ready to say goodby to your dreams.  Cons and Pros of being Engineer You will not get who you dreamt of ( in most cases). Either you end up in the second one or in a totally different one. But you will succeed 10 fold or you will be forced to change it in a few years; your dream.You will count only higher mountains but leave the rest just because they don’t come in the exam. But it will give you exposure to vast areas ( only exposure; In my thinking, engineering is also just a fat book of introduction chapters of various fields. You will never now what excite you the most, believe me).Also, Engineers are perverts to the core, they just attracted to new things every time they read or learn new and forget the previous one. But the good news is that In the end they even don’t know about any of them. Is something better which you could achieve with the same hard work and practice? Yes, you can do the same Engineering in a far greater way than you are doing it now. The things which I mentioned in 1st answer, one should carve them in their head. They are way too important for any of the students out there. I told you, those things decide whether someone will be called employed or unemployed in the end. Worthy to read-Taking your student life seriously, choosing good mentors to help you sail the job-seeking days, compromise accommodations, not the job, prepare everything in advance, build up a pile of references before you set foot in the outside world.

The question is why 90% of the students are unemployed in india? Thats because of our education system and business. Our education system is totally usless, it has outdated subjects and worthless methods, if you study a subject which is practised in 80s then who do you get job in 20s. You are studying an 20th century subject in 21 st century, how can you get job? We have to invent time machine and go back and get ourselves placed. Also, Industries are updating every year, even every month, people are much needed in every field, every sector, but the problem is, our education system doesn't value creativity and skills, it only values grades, why? Because education is just a business field. Techinical degrees needs practical skills, still every college or university, focus on usless old theories, then what knowledge can a student get or gained? Nothing. There are also other factor, darkest reality Parents are the 1st biggest problem for dreams of a children. No matter how much creative that child is , matter how much he is passionate about his dreams, no matter how much spontaneous he is, their parents will always destroy their dreams and want to be iniddle of crowd and copy others. Also, our school education rules are much worse, the rules we follow on school is the same as in prison, the education system of us is training starting from 1 st standard to college graduation, to be slaves to business and politics. If you are really passionate about Engineering, its still a good choice, but abroad studies is far better. As they have updated subjects and give importance to Practical knowledge and projects. Abroad have more opportunities as in india, it's just a political business arena. We have taught only limited options and we are blindly following it. There are hundreds of course available but no one teaches us because they don't want us to be knowledgeable. Parents also without thinking, because they are brainwashed, forcing their children into the field where their children are not in, even there itself not exploring the career options, they blindly want to copy others and living a usless life in shadows. Some of degrees are outdated in india like mechanical, computer, etc. Why because, a computer science student have job option like data science, AI, graphic design, etc rather going for CS , they can go directly for bachelor in data science, AI, game design, graphic design, etc. Mechanical engineering is very usless degree they are giving now, it is very old, outdated, and no use in present and also in future unless it is changed. There are more and more problems buddy, Engineering is one of most respected field, but due to politics and business in india, Engineering looses its name, abroad studies is always better rather than wasting our life in india.

The possibilities are endless, let me paint you a picture of my back story. I graduated from SRM University NCR campus with degree in electronics and communication engineering. I was lucky enough to bag an offer from Capgemini in campus placements and spent three years there trying to figure out the right skills to learn because I did not get much exposure and experience that would help me grow in the ultra competitive market. Then I spent a majority of my free time learning and upgrading myself so that I could equip my arsenal with the required arms to venture into my dreams and behold I landed an offer with Mercedes Benz. I Learned a lot during my stint with them, travelled the world, drove the most swankiest of cars I could only dream of and the rest is history. Till now I have worked with one of the best brands in the world and I am currently at the prime of my life. So the moral of the story is hardwork pays off and it absolutely doesnt matter which college or institution you pass out from. Keep learning and keep rocking!!! "

Conduct a quantitative study of YOUR OWN - compare and use rankings of not one or two, but a number of ranking systems - NIRF, THE, QS - there are a lot. Now don’t just go and compare and say “X is at rank 1 whereas as Y is at rank 2, so it is obviously better!” - dig deep. What metrics are they using? Are the metrics biased? Are the metrics inclined towards factors that don’t have a proper definition ? (like “reputation”) How have the rankings improved over the years? Is the university stagnant? Or worse are the ranks dropping? Does the university have appropriate accreditation? For placements, go through each of the university websites and collect data directly from them. Not from Quora, not from your neighbor but directly from their website. If for some reason, they don’t have the data, contact the college (also possibly a red flag) Go through their social media handles. Find what else the university does, research aspects, etc. It is easy to read Quora and read one guy saying “X is at rank 1 by ABC ranking - it is the best!!!” and some others saying the complete opposite. This is something you have to do because it is your responsibility to make sure that you don’t end up in a place where you don’t want to be. For comparing numbers, do not read people’s opinions, they are almost always biased and that is something you cannot afford for the first part of your study. It is, by no doubts, a painstaking long process but once you have a firm ground to stand, you can think of running :) 2 - A purely opinion based study The numbers play no part for this part of the study. By opinion of people, I do not mean random strangers you find on Quora or any website - I mean the students. Approach students from the colleges in question, preferably ask one from each year - 1st, 2nd, 3rd and final year (if it’s B.Tech) Ask them relevant questions - how is the campus atmosphere? Is the teaching diligent? Are assignments and exams conducted just for the sake of conducting? Is there ragging? How friendly are the seniors? Are there student clubs? How good are the student clubs? How good are the hostels? Are the faculty approachable? Is the administration too strict/ too lax? What are some common nuisances that you face? Try to connect with the alumni too, if possible, they would be undoubtedly much more wise. How can you connect with these people? Well the world is your oyster - Quora, Facebook, Instagram, Twitter - endless ways to do it. Try to ask as many people as possible, so you make sure you reduce the chance of bias. Don’t hesitate, because your future depends upon it! Doing this, you might make some friends who might just play a crucial role in your life ;) I will reiterate what I have said before for the previous section - This is something you have to do because it is your responsibility to make sure that you don’t end up in a place where you don’t want to be. On a final note, the numbers matter less, in my opinion, because numbers can’t capture each and every aspect of the hundreds of factors that go into play. For instance, campus atmosphere. What’s the point if a college claims top placements but most of the students in a class are engaged doing illicit activities like drugs? What a student says about a college has more weight. Because he has been there, lived there. He or she has already committed and put trust on the college and he or she knows more than just those rankings you see on college websites. Those things play a role of course, but don’t over emphasize. At the end of they day, it’s your call to make. Regarding Amrita, I can certainly help you with the second part since I study in Amritapuri. I’m a B.Tech (CSE) Student at Amrita, Amritapuri (2018–22). The strongest factor in favor of Amrita, in my humble opinion, is its student club culture. Amritapuri hosts two of India’s top student clubs - amFOSS and Team bi0s. amFOSS is India’s leading FOSS and Computer Science club and bi0s is India’s ranked 1 cybersecurity team in CTFs since the last many years. More info on respective websites. I joined amFOSS in 2018, in my first year. Since then, I have been a Google Summer of Code Student in 2019, a Google Summer of Code Mentor this year, gave a couple of talks at international conferences (funded) and have a had a hell of a time so far with seniors and peers who are nothing more than family now. I will clarify - I spent every day after class at amFOSS Lab, received guidance, worked my ass off - just like my peers and seniors there. It wasn’t magic. It took work. Days and weeks and months of work. But only work doesn’t pay it off, the right exposure and guidance helps, and it multiplies your effort exponentially. Now these aren’t the only clubs, there are other great clubs as well. For instance, Code@Amrita, which is a competitive programming club. The team has a history of participating in ICPC World Finals twice. Non-CS branches have active clubs as well - HuT Labs, Baja, Supra and so on - you will find details of them on the Amrita website. So campus atmosphere? 10/10 if you make use of it ;) Ragging? None. I personally haven’t faced a situation nor have most of my friends. The administration is pretty strict about it (as they should be) so no need to worry. The hostels are OK. The first year hostel isn’t awesome but it gets a lot better after first year. ( Also I think they are constructing a new one for first years ) Food? This is subjective. It’s not bad but it’s certainly getting better. Comparing to my first year, the food is much better. The seniors agree with me. It is not bland but the food serves its purposes but it does take some getting used to. There are, of course, hotels nearby. Internet? The college provides WiFi in and around the campus and the hostels. The speed is decent enough - anywhere from 1 to 5+ Mbps depending on time and location. Faculty? All of whom I’ve encountered so far have been very friendly and approachable and that could be said to all of them, in general. Most of the classes have projectors and stuff, the labs are cool and most of the time, doesn’t feel “outdated” (as my peers from other colleges tend to say) Overall, administration and faculty are OK. Any other questions? Drop them below. Good luck!

SRM is located in the district of kattankulanthur and has a equally good campus but it's far away from the main city, and I personally didn't like the outskirt area of SRM.Hostel and mess : KIIT hostels are better hands down. The rooms you get is great for the price you pay. SRM hostels are old and overpriced. Even the mess food was not upto the mark for the price you pay at SRM.Academics: I personally found SRM curriculum challenging and better than KIIT. Exams are taken quite seriously. Academics wise SRM is better.International Relations : SRM has great tie-ups and opportunities for people who really want a great exposure, there are plenty of clubs and students who are interested get great opportunities for going abroad.Faculty : Most of the faculty at SRM are from South India, mainly from Tamil Nadu. And most teachers at KIIT will be from North India.Placements: These days companies visit most of the private colleges for recruitment. I personally found that the placement scenario for was same for both the colleges, the selection was based on placement exams by respective companies. It won't make a huge difference if you join either of them.Personal Opinion : Both KIIT and SRM are well established colleges, and you won't go wrong with either of them. In my opinion, you should choose the college whose culture and location would suit you the best. Feel free to reach out for any other queries. "

Else SRM KTR is a good option as campus life placements are really good here for CS/IT branches . But there will be around 1–1.5k students in CS branch in SRM (Around 2k when all campuses combined). Hence there will be a huge fight for placements in SRM. In that perspective PICT would be a better option for you as there is ease of getting placed. You might even end up in a company that you desire. In the end its your choice whether you want quality campus life (SRM) or better placements (PICT). Curriculum wise both are great. If you are planning to do research projects then SRM would do better. Also if you are someone from north, it would be tough to settle here in Chennai initially do keep that in mind.

This training is also important because 90% of the companies coming for recruitment in SRM are IT companies. So give full attention to this training and trust me guys this training is very beneficial for all the students. Simultaneously, the classes will also go on in your campus but the students attending the training will get full OD for it so no worries of attendance guys. The students of various branches of SRM also comes to the KTR campus for the placements and they are accommodated in SRM hostels or BEL building. Nothing will be reduced in the 4th year infact the work pressure and load will increase as you have to manage the academics also without attending the classes for 1 month and you have to sit for the placement exams also. Some of the days are such that you have to sit twice or thrice for the placement exams as many companies comes to the college on the same day. So this all happens in 7th semester. After the semester exams the college announce for holidays but the companies still come to college for placements so most of the students stay back and don't go home. Then comes the last semester i.e 8th semester. Placement continues but 80% of the students have been placed till now. So most of the student's time is spend in there rooms only as no classes are there in this semester and only major project is there so the students have to go once a week to the college for attendence. Finally by the month of April the Major project thing is done and students leave for there home in the month of May saying Goodbye to the college life forever. Thank you. "

Normal qouta fees was 2,15,000 Rs and Management qouta fees was 3,60,000 Rs for all branches except Aerospace and Automobile, they were bit costlier than other branches. So yeah this was the Fee structure in 2016. For 2020, it must have raised to 2.5 to 2.6 Lakhs/yr, you can confirm it from the website. I would suggest it is a heavy investment on BTech from SRM , actually it is a heavy investment from all private colleges. I chose SRM because I got a good rank in SRMJEE and I was getting a good branch in KTR campus and there were not very good options in my hand at that time, so yeah this was the reason I chose SRM. "

Had I been at your place I would have definitely taken JAM one more time. Frankly speaking I do not have any idea regarding Bio-Technology at SRM but I know for sure that the facilities at IITs would be far better than what you would get at SRM. Now as far as India is concerned, job opportunities in Bio-Technology is limited as it is an emerging subject in our country. You would hardly have any core Bio-Tech companies visiting campuses for recruitment. Can't say exactly about other institutes but at least that's the case in my college. Most of the Bio-Tech guys here either went for non core jobs like software and analytics or they went for higher studies like M.S and PhD. Personally if you ask me research in Bio-Technology has got a much wider scope and opportunities as compared to job sector in the same. Hence I am assuming you if you are planning to study Bio-Technology you would for your masters degree you would also try to go for higher study for which obviously IITs would be preferred by the majority because they are the amongst the best institutions for technical education in our country. Do not get me wrong, I am not saying that SRM is bad but whatever I spoke is based on the general perception. Hence it would be better if you could get in touch with someone who has studied at SRM before taking your final decision because he/she can only tell you the truth about the concerned department wrt to lab facilities, quality of faculties and most importantly the placement scenario over there. Hope this helps and all the best. "

However, their minimum eligibility criteria for an Indian student for all major subject is as follows: A certificate representing 12 years of academic education (excluding pre-school or kindergarten years) with an equivalent of first division achievement in senior secondary school is required for freshman application. (Examples: All India Senior School Certificate, Indian School Certificate, Delhi Senior School Certificate, Higher Secondary Certificate).

One of the easiest exam to clear just you have to focus on some topics.

Try to covered all chapter because in Srmjeee you will get one question from every chapter. In Srmjeee you will get 105 questions including physic+chemistry+maths. Try to solve around 70 to 80 questions correct you will do that definitely your rank will land under 10k don’t attempt any question which don’t know because it will effect your result due to negative marking.

The faculty is ordinary yet very very supportive.The labs are very easy to score and most questions are from previous years and class assignments. It is the most easiest to score marks.Teachers give maximum marks as compared to other branches so getting a 9+ cgpa is very easy.Read very easy. Classes are chilled out and there are many free hours lab records and assignments are minimum. You will not learn anything by attending theory classes. You will have to mostly study on your own and develop programming skills. You have plenty , Read Plenty of free time , you need to be self taught and develop good knowledge of algorithms and data structures. There are lot of CSE sponsored projects going on. It's very easy to get OD/Medical in CSE no long procedures. HOD is very helping and supporting. It is very easy to get permission for internships and SAP. I'll give you few examples- Approximately 100/200 students have got placed in major/minor product companies in just 50 days of placements. This should pretty much sum up the benefits of CSE. Initially students loathed and mocked CSE but in the end they realized it's the most chilled out branch and promise a bright career ahead if you work hard on your own and not being dependent on you teachers.

Kindled by the call to have more Intellectual Property Rights (IPRs), the higher education sector has witnessed many reforms. The UGC’s call to universities (highlighted above), has come after a series of policy directives to introduce awareness about IP in higher educational institutions. The number of patents applied for, granted and commercialized by universities and institutes is factored in in the National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF) rankings with no surprise that the top ranked engineering institutes in India are also the leading filers of patents. The National Assessment and Accreditation Council(NAAC), awards up to 24 points to an institute which sets up an innovation ecosystem and has a facility for identifying and promoting IPRs. Also, the All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE) model curriculum for its member institutions lays emphasis on the need for IPR education in technical institutes. Chandigarh University being the only university in achieving NAAC accreditation in lesser time strongly believes in filling the IPR’s very often and has moved up the ladder amongst various Universities in India.

To answer this let me define what a patent is and why its important to file patents.  A patent is an exclusive right granted by a country to an inventor, allowing the inventor to exclude others from making, using or selling his or her invention in that country during the life of the patent.It does NOT give the inventor the right to use or ""practice"" the invention, and thus the right is subject to any prior rights that others may have to related inventions.

To answer this let me define what a patent is and why its important to file patents.  A patent is an exclusive right granted by a country to an inventor, allowing the inventor to exclude others from making, using or selling his or her invention in that country during the life of the patent.It does NOT give the inventor the right to use or ""practice"" the invention, and thus the right is subject to any prior rights that others may have to related inventions. So for example, if you have a patent on a “vessel to hold coffee” and I have a patent on a “handle for a vessel”, then I can prevent you from putting a handle on a coffee cup and you can prevent me from attaching a cup to my handle.A patent is issued to the individual inventor and not to a company, although it is typical practice to have employees assign inventions to their employer.Patent protection is available for any product, process or design that meets certain requirements of novelty, non obviousness and utility. For most categories of inventions, patent protection in the United States lasts for 20 years from the date the patent is filed (under prior law it was 17 years from the date the patent issued).Amongst many patents being filed by Universities in India, let me provide you with the details of recent patents filed by Chandigarh University which have the potential to make a significant impact on society on a local, regional, national and global scale.  Recently, many of the University students & researchers from Bio-technology and Pharmacy contributed greatly in the field of research by filing more than 25 patents in the field of medicine and health sciences making it the University with a maximum number of patents in India.

There are in total 4 campuses under SRM Institute of Science and Technology in the states of Tamil Nadu and Delhi NCR. I am a graduate from the Delhi NCR campus which is actually situated on the Delhi-Haridwar Highway. Evidently, I opted for the hostel accommodation because the locality doesn't allow for a safe PG or flat. In my three years of Hostel Life, I realised quite a few points which I shall be jotting down below. The hostel IN timings are strict. There is a timetable followed and every resident is advised to follow that.There is no trace of Ragging. Even though from second year onwards, the juniors and seniors share the same building, the environment is really friendly and homely.The wardens take attendance every night without fail. This point stands in favour of the college for the parents who are contemplating the choice of college for their child.The food in my campus was better than average. Mess had proper menus. There was meal served 4 times a day. Also, the hygiene is clearly standardised and sincerely followed. I have heard of complaints from the Tamil Nadu campuses regarding the quality of food but I didn't face any such issue.These are a few plus points that can help you decide. The only drawback lies within the place it is situated. There are not many superstores around so we used to buy our basic amenities online. I hope I have been of some help. All the best !"

I believe I can answer your question. Unemployment is not a myth here. It’s just a promotional pickup line used by the college. But it’s not their fault either. Let me give you a clear insight into what’s going on here. I’m doing my Bachelor’s in Mechanical engineering at Ramapuram campus. There are around 200 students who registered for placements (by paying a fee of 6k) in our department. Out of that, only 2 students got offers from core companies. One guy got placed in a company called Amphisoft Solutions and the other got an offer from Capgemini’s core profile. I would not blame it on the institution but on the economic state that our country’s in right now. The placed percentage in our department is less than 50%. A handful of us got offers from day-one companies (TCS, CTS, Infosys and Wipro). The rest who got placed are placed in sales profiles like byju’s etc. But that’s not the matter at all with CSE and IT departments. I think it’s safe to say that all students with skills (almost 90%) got placed with a decent if not great package. I heard that around 150+ companies visited to recruit from these departments. According to me, if I were to rate placements here it would be something like this: CSE/IT - 4.5/5 EEE/ECE - 3/5 Mech/Automobile/Civil - 1/5 But the placement authorities are trying their best to achieve 100% placements, so I would like to take a moment to credit them from their work. Hope this helps. "

There are plenty of PG and independent flat or house available. It will be good if you visit Kattankulathur before your session start, roam around places near by. If you can manage a bike it will be good. Places like Guduvancherry, Urapakkam, Maraimalai Nagar have lot of options for PG as well as independent flat or house. If you dont want to have bike then stay in Potheri. PG will be a lil costly but campus will be in walking distance, you will have lots of hotels and restaurants serving all types of foods.

Because core jobs are comparatively less here in private colleges due to large number of admissions every year. And demand for ECE engineers in India is gradually decreasing day by day in both private as well as public sector units. Only ISRO, DRDO, BARC select ECE graduates. And top firms like Texas, Intel, Cadence rarely hires EC engineers from this private institutes. So think once before going for this branch. This time they have opened new branch ECE with specialization in VLSI and Embedded System in VIT which generally EC engineers prefer to do in Masters. You can go for it as current market has high demand for VLSI engineers (Companies generally prefer Masters graduate) . You can try for off campus as well. EE and Electrical or Electrical and Electronics will always be in demand and the most suitable branch to take. The demand for EE engineers are increasing in public sectors as well as private. You can definitely take EE in VIT Vellore. Don’t take admission if you are thinking for Mechanical and Civil. Hardly 1 out of 20 students gets placed in core companies. Most of these students here prefer MBA or give GATE examination for Public Sectors or M.Tech in IITs. For Biomedical you have to do research and PhD. Hope you got your answer!!! This will be the trend for next ten years. Now as technology is growing fast and Artificial Intelligence, Machine Leaning, Deep learning, Data Security demand is increasing so it’s better to join CS or it’s allied branches and bring interest in coding and learn all these technologies. Demand will increase in next ten years and CS people will have numerous jobs with lucrative packages when they will master their skills in these technologies. These technologies need good command in Mathematics and Programming skills in Python, R, JAVA, C++. To implement these technologies in hardware good Electrical, VLSI/Embedded, Mechanical engineers are needed. So dear juniors and aspiring future engineers, think twice before selecting branch. All the best!!!!!!!!!! PS: Don’t fall into the trap of direct admission or management quota. Work hard and book your seat in good colleges. "

The institute placement record is the most fraudulent with fake placement promises. The institute bribes organizations and gets astronomical placement offers which never see light of the day. It runs a BPO such as SRMBPO which absorbs large number of students. The BPO jobs offered will be for 2–3 months and they are obtained after bribing HRs. The grading system is most fraudulent. It is designed to make students get lower than 8 CGPA so that SRMIST removes them as non placable students. Only 30% get grades of more than 8 and that is given after taking high bribes from the students and based on caste system. In India it is known as chor university and large number of reviews by students, parents give credence to the fact that it is Chor University. They claim international faculty and most of them are from local self financing third rated colleges in Tamilnadu. The doctorates are from the same university with lowest kind of supervision. The fee is the highest in India. You will get a degree after spending 30 lakhs which is worthless. Please see the videos. There are 100 clubs which collect money from students in crores which are most useless. Only 50% attend classes and rest roam with different tickets to be sold for Milan, Aarush and other sex oriented programmes. Major fashion shows are held (90 in number) for which students are made to dress with lowest taste. If you still do not believe that this kind of educational institution exists in India, please see the videos. You can buy your attendance~ Your marks ~ Your degree and placement. "

Follow latest trends in Computers, Learn about Data Analytics, ML,AI advancements etc. as the industry is focused only in this sector. Start with Python. Also keep your CGPA above 6 or minimum of 60% Coming to subjects, Focus on Electric Machines 1&2, DTSP, control systems, power electronics and power systems as these are bouncer subjects and most people are vulnerable to these subjects. Trust me you do NOT wanna fall into the arrear trap with these subjects. If you want to do research - Best of Luck for that. Do it only if you have an authentic or genuine idea. Contact your faculty. Do some research about the faculty expertise if they can guide you in that domain. If you are eying higher studies, then just manage to clear all the subjects, you’ll be fine. "

Tip: It helps strengthen your case for staying at home if you have an internship during that time ( preferably from a reputed or alteast known company) "

Most faculty members, professors and assistant professors both, have published multiple papers. Project-based learning courses are incorporated into the curriculum to encourage further research and project implementation of the subject matter. The PBL courses achieve the goal of making students conduct research, but the time limitation of a single semester (five months or less) does not assure a very high quality of research or output. However, students are encouraged to do projects outside of class, and lab facilities are mostly accessible for this purpose. The Faculty The faculty at VIT is highly qualified and come from some of the best institutes across the country. The senior professors have PhD students who act as their teaching assistants.  Of Jobs And Internships VIT has a very high placement rate, almost 100%. It has been mentioned in the Limca Book of Records thrice for the highest number of campus placements done from a single institution by a single company. The PAT centre is in charge of the placements done on campus. The VIT outsources placement training to professional companies like SMART Training Resources India and FACE Placement Training, and many highly reputed companies like Microsoft and Amazon recruit from VIT University. Most internships are found outside the university. However, VIT does have a Student Abroad Program. The students can spend a semester abroad in one of VIT’s affiliated colleges all over the world. On the other hand, International Transfer Programs offer a system by which a student spends their first two years in VIT and the next two years in a foreign university.

Getting a high CGPA does not equate to getting a high paying job. There are many things that you should do outside of your course work if you want a high paying job. 3.) You may have several problems with your roommate at SRM. If you want to switch, then it will be quite difficult, they are very reluctant to switch rooms for students, specially if you don't have anyone to switch with. 4.) Your neighbouring rooms in hostel may play loud music and stuff and your warden may not support your desire for peace. 5.) There are too many examinations at SRM. After a while, you'll be exhausted and may even loose interest in learning and start mugging up things. 6.) There are not many holidays for North Indian festivals. For Durga Puja, we get only 1–2 days of holiday. 7.) If you hate hot weather, then Chennai will be hell for you. Specially, of you take non AC hostel. 8.) Chennai area is prone to experiencing extreme weather conditions. There have been cyclones and floods here. I was here during Vardah Cyclone and it was terrible, we were all scared. I had never seen anything like it. 9.) Most of the students will not be focused towards getting a good career. So your friend circle may affect you in a negative way. You just need to choose wisely for this point though. 10.) We get very short break after semester. My friends in other universities get much longer holidays. 11.) You may regret not knowing the local language at times. 12.) The hostels and mess food are over priced. 13.) The fees is too high. 14.) The food here is too oily. 15.) I don't know how, but you may get skin allergies for the first time here. Me and my friends got some weird skin allergies for the first time and we couldn't even get a proper explanation for those. 16.) If you need to travel to the city, then it'll take 1 hour. 17.) There are too many students here. It may become difficult for you to get recognized by some professor or stuff like that. 18.) There are very few lifts and the crowd is huge. The lift management is good though. You won't have to wait for more than 15 minutes for your turn. 19.) At SRM hospital, mostly students will do your check up and they might not be good at it. 20.) The environment becomes stressful at times. This year 3 people committed suicide here. Every year at least 1 student commits suicide. (There are more than 10000 people here.) This is all I can remember. I'll update this space as I recall. Overall SRM is a good college. You'll find that majority of my above mentioned points apply almost to all the colleges. You just need to dig deeper in order to get the information. At the end of the day, you are in control of your life, not anyone else. I have seen several marvelous students coming out of SRM with happy faces, while others cry at petty things. It will be better if you choose a college according to your own taste, comfort level and ambitions. All the best! "

Don’t expect much from the faculty members but you can get amazing funding for all your ideas and you can even start your own clubs and can make a name for yourself.

You can even make it to MITs if you are dedicated enough and can devote yourself without diversions. But, what ruins it all is SRM itself. They are GREEDY AS FUCK! They cannot limit their intake. They have to have 30,000 good for nothings in the campus. They have to SELL THEIR SEATS. The seats sold is close to 70%. That ruins EVERYTHING. And the result? Mediocrity or even worse. What’s the point in teaching Machine Learning to folks whose only aim in life is to get laid or get a girlfriend? Yes, that’s 80%% of the crowd you meet here. And as you can guess, those folks have made it here by buying seats using their Baap ka paisa. Their new semester’s resolution is not to improve their GPA by studying hard but by improving their malpractice skills. The Telugu crowd is probably the worst(though there are genuine exceptions). The North Indians are the better lot(though again there are exceptions). You don’t need to have be a nerd, but at least maintain some standards close to the alumni produced by other universities. SRM University is the most depressing university one can be in if one’s got any sort of ambitions in engineering. If you haven’t made it to IITs/NITs/BITs stay clear out of such universities. It’s better to join some third grade university and stay in your home town. It’s unimaginably hard working on yourself if you cannot find a single soul who is half as like minded as you are. If you are like the other good for nothings as mentioned above, this place is your heaven. Go ahead! Buy your seat right now. You are a very crucial asset for the university to maintain its TIMES NO. 1 RANKING. Hurry up! The prices tend to increase after a while.

In the BRICS ranking which involves countries like Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa, it ranks somewhere around 261st-270th. It's Asia rank however, remains in the bracket of 301st-350th. Note that private corporate sites that present University Rankings can't be trusted as some of them ignore institutions and assort orders as per their partnership with the University. Cases like that has happened when private institutions are in question. Now for your answer. What is the global rank of SRM? Esteemed Indian Institutions like IITs and NITs and certain top institutions like Aligarh University, Jadavpur etc. rank in the 150th-600th rank. The top most being IIT Bombay at 152nd. This is based on QS 2020 rankinh which is a global leader in determining University rankings all accross the globe. Note that once you move past the 500 rank mile, determination on exact rank becomes difficult and hence they are alloted a probable rank, for eg- 501–550. Stats show that VIT, which is very similar in all aspects from SRM, has a 701–800 rank index.

Firstly I would like to say about Pros, well as a University it has got its own class and reputation. They provide state of the art infrastructure, education and environment. Teachers are highly educated. The campus is serene and decent. In terms of hygiene it is upto the mark. University canteen is big enough to accommodate comfortably. Clean drinking water is provided in each and every department through blue star water vending machine. Both hot and cold drinking water is available round the clock. In terms of cons, the university fee structure is expensive. In terms of administrative matters we need to follow lot of formalities and need to pay each and everytime. So the university administration department will squeeze your pocket upto your last count penny. If you have backlogs or arrears, then you need to pay a hefty amount for each paper. For technical training from reputed companies you need to pay a lot. So University runs on its student wealth. So only thing I can say about SRM University is before you make up your mind to study here please think about your hard earned money first and also wether you can afford in first hand. Then you come to your final decision. So friends that's all I have to say about SRM. "

I did the following things: Became decently good at one programming language(C++)Learned all the basic and necessary data structures and algorithms and implemented them until I became proficient in themDid a lot of problem-solving (codechef, hackerrank, geeks for geeks, leetcode, interviewbit, etc.)(currently all time 3rd highest rank in college)Did projects in multiple languages including C++, Python, Java, C# along with multiple frameworks such as dot.net, google cloud services, selenium, flask, etc. and also in multiple domains such as Android development, Backend API development, Web automation, scripting, Windows UI making, etc.Had a great peer group(very very important)such that almost all of them are as successful or more successful than me(or more intelligent than me(so that I always felt inferior)[very important]Watched Boku No Hero Academia(My Hero Academia) to keep myself motivated.Now coming to the placements scenario: (3rd year)Reliance came for internship: couldn’t clear the CGPA cutoff.(3rd year)Microsoft internship: Couldn’t do well due to inexperience with debugging in the mettle platform(used by MSFT to conduct their online assessment)(3rd year)Paypal internship: Couldn’t clear the CGPA cutoff.(After 3rd-year exams): Qualified for finals of Barclays India hackathon(top 20 out of 1000 teams) 50 out of 80 present on the venue were offered job letters, I wasn’t. Reviewed my interview and tried to find things I could improve(4th year) Amazon internship: Again couldn’t do well due to the same mettle platform(couldn’t print debug statements) [highly disheartened after this](4th year) Udaan(udaan.com) [My dream job that I could die for]: In the first round around 80 were selected (out of 3000+) I was one of them. The second round consisted of an implementation problem on hacker earth (I needed 5–10more min than the stipulated time hence rejected).[Quite literally cried that night](4th year) Infosys Power Programmer: Got selected for the final round of PPI of Infosys power programmer by getting top rank in their all India contest, Interviews are yet to be held(probably gonna skip).(4th year) Value Labs: Didn’t wanna get placed in the company to performed poorly in the group discussion round willingly.(4th year) Optum(Tech division of United Health Group): I was probably the only one who solved both the 2 questions in their online round(one consisting of basic DP and the second of a graph problem). During the interview round they gave me some standard leetcode questions, asked me to explain to the solution of the problems I solved in the online round. They also had questions/discussion regarding the projects I did. In the 3rd and final HR round, I was asked the tower of Hanoi problem. The interviewer was more interested in my patience than my problem-solving capability. I remained calm and explained the solution multiple times. Result: SELECTED (top 2 people out 1000+). I(8.4CGPA) was selected over people with 9.5+CGPA reason being learning was my priority over marks. Don’t just learn for exams, learn to be able to solve real-world problems with a specific goal in mind. Everything will fall in place.Many in my college/family congratulated me and said I have settled life now. I was happy but not relaxed, much less settled; because I believe the main journey of life starts after I get out of college. This is just the beginning and I am still a child in terms of my knowledge. "

That should get their attention and you can get your foot in the door. How you take it from there is your skills/talent. "

The wind tunnel is flimsy itself, the hangar is just sitting useless, I'm surprised that even with all this crap ,SRM aerospace students are still making a mark in the international arena .Go Aero (sorry for the bias)16.The Lake:How many dead bodies are piled up in there?17.The Lake (Part II): You could have used the lake as a test bed for projects in recycling, water treatment, and many many other engineering applications.18.STOP COMPETING WITH VIT: There comes point in ones life that one realizes that such petty rivalry is a waste. It's that time in life SRM.19.Fund Students: Fund their papers, projects, ideas, if you want to be a centre for learning.20.Hostel Fees: You really think you can get away with that right?21.Remove Stupid Fines!!:Your'e just making things worse for yourself. These fines are only going to make students angrier and you slightly richer.See other famous universities around the world, they have the campus alive 24x7, theres safety, and there's actual life and learning, so SRM stop making the Uni such a dull place after 6. I think i said too much. That wasn't brief at all. That's what 4 years at SRM did to me. "

For some companies it's not mandatory to be a coding-pro(but basics of coding are required everywhere). This is because most companies would later train you on their tools and technologies. Main focus is on communication skills, attitude and basics of coding. For ECE department, lowest package is around 3 lpa and highest is around 15(i think). "

If your ultimate goal is getting placed then it's a good option. I hated my college life but one thing I agree is that SRM gives you many opportunities during placement. More than 100 companies visit SRM for placement. You have to go to main campus for placement.Last semester there is only one subject in last sem that is your final year project. You have to go to college only for reviews. So while your friends go to college you can relax at home or do a six month internship whatever you like.That's it

If you are looking for something lavish or for instant a good place with a carefree neighborhood, I suggest you can look for places in Manapakkam. Bharathi Salai and it's adjoining areas are decent to stay but suffer from water and electricity problems. A PG near the college would rougly cost you somewhere between 4,500–6, 500, provided you are good at bargaining. There is a PG available at a distance of about 600 metres from college. It's located at Easwaran Nagar, beside Laundro Cafe. One of my friend stays there and quite likes it. The monthly rental is 10,000 INR. The amenities include Private room, AC, TV, attached washroom, bed, chair and study table and a cupboard.

Join any local/nearby state college, you’ll feel much more contended. Now a long, justified answer, for those having a doubt over my opinion. I am a student of final year, currently pursuing B.Tech from this University. I will trace back my journey from final year, and then leave it up to decide. Back during the joining and counselling time, when I came to Chennai for the first time, I was awestruck by the huge buildings of the campus. I am from a small town, and all these attracted me very quickly. During the counselling, we were made to run from one building of the campus to another building. I was wondering why didn’t they put up the whole admission shit at one place. Poor management has been the college’s forte from a long time I guess. Anyway, this was my first day’s experience of the college. The hostel life was no good. There were some lame rules regarding the wifi, like, it would start functioning only after 6p.m., and only upto 7a.m. I was like “WHAT???!!!”…who does that, they were charging us nearly one lacs for our hostel, and couldn’t even provide wifi for 24 hours. Like this was not enough, all the social networking apps were banned (WhatsApp, Facebook, Instagram, Hike, Viber (Calling App). Still, we managed to use VPNs to access the apps, but the speed was so shitty, that even 1G (had it ever existed) would have worked better than the wifi. Mess food should not even be discussed I guess; we all know what shit they provide at the mess, at every hostel in the country. Coming to academics. The college had one of the shittiest rules anyone might have had ever heard-collared t-shirts/shirts, jeans and shoes are mandatory. One question to the low standard management of the college, WHY? What makes you think that this will bring discipline to the college? One advice, increase the education quality, don’t make some futile rules, nobody respects you all anyway. The faculties are a lot more degraded. They study from this college, and then teach in this college. This tells you how uneducated they are. We were provided books by college for the first 2 years. Most of the boosk were written and published by the faculties of the college itself. Now imagine-studying from SRM, teaching in SRM, then providing the books to the students written by the teachers of SRM. A nursery grade kid could write a better English than these people, kudos to the education of these faculties (or as they would like to call themselves, “PROFESSORS”). The evaluation system was horrible during our time. This is the break-up of the internal marks Cycle Tests (CT) 1 - 10 marks CT 2 - 10 marks Model Exam - 20 marks Surprise Test (Which we knew about a week before, always) - 5 marks Attendance (Yes, trust me!!!) - 5 marks Aaaaand then we had our end sem exam, which had a weight age of 50 marks. So basically, all we had done during our 4 years, is given exams, every damn month. Labs have never been more useless than here. First, we have to make an ‘observation notebook’. Then, we have to copy the exact same thing in a ‘record file’. In Chandler’s way - “Could anything be more useless?” And it doesn’t end here. After writing the record, you have to get the signature of the Lab In charge (who will make you run behind him like you’re his pet), then the HOD (who doesn’t even care to look what’s inside the file), then a stamp from the department office. And what will they do after all this in the University Practical Exam? Punch a hole in the file and give it back to you. You will suddenly have this irresistible urge of ripping the faculty’s body apart and shredding him/her into pieces and feeding it to the stray dogs. Don’t even think of arguing with the faculties. They will make sure that you don’t pass the semester, and will always find an excuse to kick you out of the class, like you’ve been trying sell his both the kidneys (although eventually you’ll wish to do this :D :P ). Once they will find you in some wrong-doing, they will not leave any stone un turned to serve vengeance. The teaching methodology is like something from the medieval period. They will teach you in the dumbest way possible, making the topic all the more obscure, in such a way that the concept will float in front of your eyes in the most haphazard manner. Many seminars, talks, sessions took place in our college. We were forced to attend those, as the faculties had the bait of attendance. They always said that we have to compulsorily attend the seminar, as attendance will be taken there. We knew that nothing as such would happen, still we always fell into this trap, I don’t know why. You all must have heard of the saying - All that glitters is not gold. This fits perfectly for our ‘Fests’. The more they boasted of it to be a grand event, the more hollow it turned out every time. It’s a humble request - don’t ever think of attending the fests. Instead, utilize the 4–5 days’ holiday and just go to any hill-station nearby (there’re many-Coorg, Munnar, Kodaikanal, Ooty are a few to be named). They could’t even welcome John Abraham properly; he was addressed as a “model, and a bollywood actor”. Shame on you, SRM!!! Skipping the sophomore and the 3rd year, jumping straight to the final year, because the nonsense followed suit. This is when you’ll realize how low this college could sink to create a fake impression in front of companies. Infosys was called for a seminar, which the college tagged as ‘pre-placement talk’. And the company came after almost about a month, for the actual placement process. This was done just to make the company feel that the students are interested in their placements. I am from a non CS/IT/Software branch. So obviously I didn’t know anything about coding. We were made to sit forcefully for TCS recruitment process, and were threatened of being removed from the placements if we didn’t attend their training session. Here’s a screenshot of the mail sent by a faculty of mechanical engineeringbranch to its faculties. You can see what kind of sorcery they were doing for us, in the name of ‘helping the students in the placement process’  Now the mail which was sent to us  This was almost a kind of blackmailing. We had no choice but to sit for the placement. And above that, we were made to learn C programming language in 2 days, with a lecture of 2 hours a day. What on earth made them think it was ever possible? So basically, the faculties were deciding in which company we were supposed to sit. Never even my parents had done this, who are they (faculties) to take decision on this subject? Now this is all one person’s view, which is subjective, let’s go in an objective way. Here are some stats Tuition Fees - 1.85 lacs Books Fees - 15 thousand, which just included 6–7 third class quality books, and a drafter and a cheap geometry box, which broke in the first 2 months of usage. We didn’t get the drafter and the geometry box in the 2nd year. CDC Fees - Another 15 thousand, which included only 2 books of Quantitative Aptitude and 1 book on Verbal Aptitude Hostel And Mess Fees - Approximately 98 thousand. A room which was meant for 2 people previously had started accommodating 3 people Laundry Fees - 5/6 thousand (can’t remember it exactly). It was also compulsory, and we were not allowed to give more that 14 clothes in a week, which included only 1 bed sheet. If clothes were extremely, dirty, they would return them without even washing. Many a times clothes were misplaced. Examination Fees - Approximately 2.3 thousand. This is to be paid before every semester exam. Now the hefty fines. ID Card Lost - 1500. By making a DD, they won’t even accept cash. Renewal of ID Card - 1000. Same process Exam Admit Card Lost - 760 If caught cheating/malpractice in the end semester - 10 thousand. All the papers will be cancelled. So to all those people out there, thinking of joining the “Number 1 Private University In India”, please save your parents’ hard earned money, and join any other, I repeat, ANY OTHER COLLEGE IN INDIA, BUT NOT SRM UNIVERSITY.

You will also get shit pieces. This is the same water they will use to cook. This is hostel. Academics Fortunately for me I'm an alumni. So, I am at much liberty to explain in detail the atrocities students face in this college. It is the most hardworking students made the campus placement success and not the university. Okay, what do you look for in a good college? Good infrastructure, education, technology, placements etc. First of all Chuck all that! Don't even expect the college to provide you clean drinking water or clean restrooms. I'm a 2016 pass out and the CSE department used to be much less crowded like we had hardly 250 people in our batch. Most of the times, the water purifier will not be working and there will be no water to drink. You must carry water from home (luckily my home was quite close) to stay hydrated throughout the day. There was this one time we found a worm in the drinking water and when we complained to the floor in-charge, she promptly whisked away the bottle. She said the problem is being looked into and returned an empty bottle (not that we are going to upload it online or something but the things these people do to cover up stuff). No one to bother. You will see large number of relatives of the Chancellor sitting as employees and telling us that they are his relatives and need not work. What is this? 70% of the time, the restrooms will be stinking and the yucky smell will be gracing the classrooms too. And the best part they will lock the restrooms promptly by 4. I mean, is somebody gonna steal something from there? Food (poor hostellers!)- this one is from them. Though they paid 80,000 mess fees (in 2016, I'm not sure about the fees now), most of them ate food from outside. There was an infamous video on worm infested tea can being used to serve tea in the boys hostel. And 90% of hostellers start living outside from 2nd year to save money paid (rather wasted) as hostel and mess fees. Now that we have covered about your basic needs, let's move to why you are actually there. Education: Books: They will steal money in the name of book fees right under your nose. Rs. 15,000 for some 20 books, 5 records and an E.G set. The best part?I heard the present juniors are not even given these books. None of the books were from the given syllabus. We protested and started buying books on our own from 3rd sem.Faculty : 90% politics, 10% knowledgeable. Very very few professors are actually knowledgeable. Rest are just there to torture you to show other faculty that they are being strict, prim and proper. If you talk back, you might as well sign your death warrant. If you ask questions, they will get irritated and will see to that you get into problem.You'll have to beg them, pacify them blah blah for them to sign your records. Oh how many times they will make you walk back and forth for that dumb record! Rumors fly people! The faculty are more kiddish than the students.And don't wait up for somebody to teach you. No one will. Take a print out of the syllabus paper. Rush to the library. Pick up the needed books. Start learning. Don't expect any faculty to teach you new programming languages or something. You ARE on your own. In KTR campus one of the staff in management department was working in a beauty parlor as a massage madam and she got her PhD in how to run beauty parlors! Shame such teachers are there to teach in a professional university. She will entice students to come her massage cum beauty parlor.Labs: Oh! Our good ole' computer labs. Hardly 10–15 systems worked properly among the 60 or so systems in a lab. Be ready to share.Infrastructure : Dude! Have you seen the cracks on the buildings? And the ongoing construction work? Be ready to navigate among the steel rods, cracked roads, swamp created during and after rain. Don't be fooled by the look of admin office. It's the only decent looking building in the campus. No playground and be ready to navigate from one block to another for VAC class. You will be wasting time to go for VAC. Placements: The ultimate reason why people fall into this crappy institution. that 100% placements record? If you are not placed by the end, you'll be forced to take up BPO job offers so that they can maintain their record. Dress Code: Subject to changes by the floor in-charge. If they are in a good mood, kurti and leggings are allowed. If they are having a bad day, they will literally call you and scream at you for wearing tight clothes. If you are a hosteller, they will ask you to go change and then come attend the classes. What have I learned in the 4 years? Well, I have learned to educate myself, to handle tough people and tough situations. My patience level has gone up after these 4 years. And I did meet and network with a lot of people. Your interpersonal skills will see a boost. You are looted and you are on your own. "

I am from the 2017 batch and I can tell you with all my experience that BBA in SRM is very bad and unprofessional. TBH , This is an engineering university and not a Business school therefore the management doesn't give much importance to the commerce batch. The teaching here is very poor and there is no guarantee in your future as SRM literally works on money. I have known my seniors who worked up tirelessly day and night to get a good standard grade but in the end ,they now work in odd jobs. SRM is just a name in the area and it's fancy building and popular lifestyle attracted many young people like me and but the picture was clearer only during our college time , they give us many promises on internship and job gurantee but nothing like that is there. Only if your celebrity's child or some famous person in the campus , then will you get the satisfaction you require. BBA is nothing in SRM , we taught very badily and given minimum attention and when we complain , the management just ignores us , again like I said , this is a Engineering university , not a Business school. I would strongly recommend that you search somewhere else and not join SRM unless your core is engineering. Engineering is really the best here but as business school student , your output is nothing compared to students from other B-schools. The burden on me has only begun and now as my year ends I have to find a place to work and payback the money to the bank . They once gave me a promise on Jobs and Internship , nothing came and now I have to beg for a job. Please go somewhere else , SRM is buying your future and not protecting it. This is not just my word but the words of the entire batch . Don't let the fanciness get hold of you , you just saw the outer cover. P.S Make your own future "

Playing with the life of children and also charging for those examination fees they never took(that point aside)Above rule was questioned to examination head so he bluffed all children saying it was made by vice chancellor’s decision and the real question here was that SUPPOSE if any trouble was with elections then election commission was responsible not prime minister same no body here knows there work and they intend to play with degrees of children and sure making money out it as charging examination fees again and again.This very same year a teacher teaching in CSE second year two subjects to same class debarred more than 50 students and here the question was if more than half class was failed then whose mistake was this as a teacher is one who concentrate on some below average students, so point here is teachers first didn’t teach properly and if they do so they only concentrate on cream students of class who actually learn from outside institutes and campus ignores it and try to cover it(Proof will be in below point of same). This was just a part of CSE and it might happen in other course too but sure not at this extent.This year no engineering student was permitted at time of admission counselling from 3rd May 2019 to 13th May 2019 except those cream students because they don’t want this reality to come out and how their teachers are treating children. This clearly shows how this college is in terms of studies. If don’t believe go in regular days and ask how the college is promise You will never see towards here.If you are student coming here after taking a student’s loan in hope that you will get anything then this is very wrong perception of yours no student here have got any good acceptable packages and amazon came for placement didn’t find any one even to consider.iMac Labs is only for show purpose no student ever worked there until a video was to be filmed and then to just switched them.IBM is also a perfect bluff as lab has no proper internet connection and syllabus is still not given, books arrive after a semester then when they were supposed to be given, College teachers teaches in class saying are we less than IBM faculty (if not, why didn’t they hire you), Short IBM faculty, saving money with the fact we paid more to get IBM faculty because SRM Sonipat new faculty is like that above same teacher, in short ask IBM students of class that how it is, don’t just believe what they tell you at time of admission as one IBM student is a 10–12 lack and 60 per class imagine what they will say just to make you take that course and just believe you wont get what you invest.Here, these were few of many points that why not to take admission in this college and how it is in 2019 and Just don’t believe me come and ask to children not just one but many as you are paying good amount of money and some taking loans to pay it make sure you get what you deserve as in short, worst teachers, no placements, some labs for admission showcase and much more surprises (Just visit us once real students not those placed students by campus at time of admission)Please reconsider if paid there fees, get it refunded. I had no one to tell me but don’t want it to happen with others and if taken and your child is not good at cramming will surely say after a year or two why the F*** I was thinking and my life is destroyed.

Generally I have seen the students feel that they have more knowledge or they treat the teacher disrespectfully provided they get sometimes a victim of South and North dispute. But generally the teachers are helpful and they always be there for u even they do overtime in helping u for your projects and exam u just need to be more respectful and attentive. Coming to the part of placement when I graduated back in 2018. More than 450 companies came for the placements so there is ample opportunities for u to be placed in good firms. All the best for the Future…

If you want to know if SRM is worth it, you can read my answer about CSE (It holds true for ECE too). Anirudh Ramesh's answer to Is it worth doing CSE at SRM and in the KTR campus? However, for Mechanical engineering, I will not pick the VDP campus (or any other campus other than the main campus). ECE department in VDP is one of the best I have seen. Computer Science is as good as the main campus. However, save for ECE, for everything else, I will pick the main campus over all others. Especially for Computer Science because - few of the opportunities (Such as internships) are informed first to the main campus students (and on occasion ONLY to the main campus students). There isn’t a huge uproar over this because most students do not know such a thing has happened until much after. Also, you will have a large student group studying with you who will keep you apprised of events that might be of interest to you (Internships, job fairs). This community is naturally smaller in other smaller campuses. "

But still, one needs to work hard and perform well in placement rounds to secure a good job. You can't compare the IITs and NITs from any other Indian Government Colleges or Private Universities as there is no comparison in such brand names. What is PSIT, i don't know, so now talking about the Lovely Professiona Continue ReadingDear student, from any institution the main thing which you need to gain is the knowledge about the subject or course you are studying. I agree that brand name do matters and people flaunt about being an Indian Institutes of Technology or National Institutes of Technology (NITs) student. But still, one needs to work hard and perform well in placement rounds to secure a good job. You can't compare the IITs and NITs from any other Indian Government Colleges or Private Universities as there is no comparison in such brand names. What is PSIT, i don't know, so now talking about the Lovely Professional University- LPU, as i am an alumni of Lovely Professional University- LPU, i can tell you about the real side of this University from my own experience. LPU is a very young university, only about 15 years old as a stand alone University. Previously it came under I. K. Gujral Punjab Technical University from 1991 to 2006.  But in this 15 years of journey, the university really struggled a lot and because of its #ThinkBig concept and various innovations in curriculum, the university is standing tall and proud with various other very old and reknowned institutions in terms of rankings and accreditations. Now lets talk about the facilities, if you are looking for industry oriented academics, practical based curriculum, professional corporate culture during the college life itself, and a better placement in any fortune company, then Lovely Professional University- LPU is totally worth it. Let me clear you why. Generally the basic factors you see in any university or institute, while choosing it for your future are your desired branch with a good infrastructure, placements, academics, faculties and support.           Again comparison helps when you are confused between the two options. If you have any other options apart from LPU, which forced you to ask this worthy question, then better visit all the options and compare the basic common needs. Honestly, I was confused too before coming here in LPU. For solving this confusion, I looked for the best key points that define the institute as the best education body. I have brief knowledge about LPU, so I can help you with that. 1. Infrastructure: The University is spread over 600 acres which provides each and every facility to their students inside the campus. Well, considering education, well-equipped labs are designed with the experienced faculty and the lab assistants that make you excel in the study.        The faculty members are the student-friendly that you won't regret study in the university. But let me buzz you that we have more than 13,000 CCTV installed in the campus so be careful on your moves.  2. Faculty: Every semester, the syllabus is updated. The faculty members are available all the time of the week so that the student can approach any time of the week. We have lots of experienced faculty members specialised in the certain fields that can help you boost the knowledge, help build up your projects, guide you in your pace of life, any personal or educational issues, etc.  4. Diversity: The University with the most diverse student population. Students from all across the world live in the hostel, which comes closest to being 'a home away from home'. The mixture of races and religions helps to build a decent environment. It’s very exciting because you’ll get a chance to interact with people from different nationalities, cultures and different backgrounds. Being a part of this university is always what I had hoped for from the time my neighbour shared with me his college life experience at LPU.    5. Campus Life: At the end of a tiring day or week, everyone expects entertainment and refreshing ways to uplift their daily boring schedule. But here in LPU, they conduct so many big events where they call popular celebrities and help their students to feel more alive and energetic, which make the life in LPU more of fun.         6. Placements: LPU has excelled in the placement records as students are trained with the professional enhancement program classes, where they teach and educate you about the interview skills and etiquettes. Moreover, the university has been ranked high by outer agencies also with regard to placements of our students. Well let me tell you about recent trends of placements in LPU. As if at the end of your degree, you got a dream package in any fortune company, then according to me everything is worth it. LPU being the Largest Private University in India having 30000+ students studying in more than 200+ courses, which includes 6000+ international students from 70+ countries, LPU has lived up to its expectations, with the quality of education satisfying these international students, the placement opportunities are amazing as well. AA+ Infrastructure including shopping malls, refreshment centers, Largest Private University Accommodation in the world, 13000 + CC cameras, indoor transportation system, University Management System, etc With Quality Education, Placements in LPU is also amazing, with the top brand in the world coming for recruitment provides great opportunities to its students. Some of the Placement opportunities in LPU : More than 550 students hired on a single day by Cognizant, not once but TWICE that is more than 1000 students, which has set a record in the whole of North India.2019, 3 Engineering students offered 28 LPA from AMAZON for their AI SKILLS.LPU’s Business School’s Bachelors students recruited for ROYAL BANK OF SCOTLAND.MBA students are getting placed at an average package of >4–6 LPA in more than 100 companies. More than 150+ companies have already visited 2017–2017 MBA batch of MBA and nearly all of them are already placed and many of them already on OJT(on the job training) These are some of the companies which come for placements at a very good package for all courses. Hyatt Regency Miami USA and Great Wolf Lodge Wisconsin selected 6 students at the package of 15 Lakh Per Annum.  Hotel Management students are getting placed in the above companies, which LPU has collaboration and tie-ups with.  Agricultural Students are recruited in some of the most well-known companies as above. The talented individual always has the opportunity of getting a gold medal, it is very much possible and what about getting your degree on your convocation from personalities like The President of India, The Vice President of India, His Holiness The Dalai Lama, The President of Mauritius, etc, the list will go on.Overall LPU provides placement opportunities to all the deserving candidates, from all courses. It is up to the student's capability to be able to grab the opportunity or not. Till now thousand of students are placed at a very good package all around the world. Some of the alumni are working in the top 10 brands in the world. I said alumni, that includes me, and working in top brands with a heavy package, even after doing masters or giving any other exam, makes the graduation from Lpu, totally worth it. Now I hope this much content is enough for you to make a decision, and yeah stop depending on others statements, and go and see the reality on the ground. Visit the campus, check the labs, infrastructure, faculty and everything which you wants and then decide. It will help you better. Happy learning.

Here the students only want to enjoy and there are very few like minded who are serious about their career. Their alumni network is also pathetic too followed with the placements which is only sales roles. The faculties are really good except for two teachers by the name of Ramachandran Sir who never shows up to class but does not feel ashamed to draw a salary despite having no knowledge of the subject and Priya K mam whose idea of teaching is reading from the books.

The campus itself is very amazing as well as the hostel life. Academically, we're always learning something new, doing something new, and progressing ahead everyday. Our college focuses on developing it's courses, by asking the students for reviews as well as the companies where their students have been hired, and so this way, we're close to perfecting our curriculum. We're a relatively new college, but still our growth has been exponential and it will keep growing in the coming years. Our faculty is a mixture of young as well as old and they're very modern in their approach. So, we get the opportunity to work on research papers and projects with the faculty and also have various workshops, seminars and conferences which are conducted within our college to promote start ups, and educate students about patents, IoT, Blockchain, Cyber-security etc. When I was researching about colleges, the one thing I thought about the most, was the student to teacher ratio. And when a college like SRM takes in 20000–30000 students every year, and students with 40000–50000 rank get branches like CSE, IT etc. it's just unfair to the rest of the students. The sheer number of students is so much that thinking about the involvement of the faculty with the students and the placement opportunities, Manipal Jaipur would be a better option any day. Since, entry into the Manipal Colleges are solely based on your performance in the entrance tests and there aren't any reservations, therefore due to less number of students, the opportunities you get are far more than what you would get in any other college. You have alot more freedom in MUJ than SRM any day and the 4 years of college are supposed to be enjoyed(with limitations of course). And this is something which you will never have in SRM. We have double occupancy and single occupancy rooms, attached bathrooms, and a lesser number of students who you need to compete with. The possibility of working in projects and research papers, the ability to secure internships abroad through IAESTE, and clubs like ACM IEEE and ECell which organize various talk shows, conferences, seminars, for the all around development of all the students. MUJ ACM Student Chapter being the 2nd best Student Chapter, in ACM India, organizes C, C++, Python, ML/AI, Cybersecurity classes for the students, to help develop their skills, something which isn't seen everywhere. The seniors are very approachable, and forever ready to help you, be it academically to clear your doubts, or non academics related as well. "

MIT was established in 1957, while MUJ was established in 2011. So yes, there’ll be a difference. But it’s fair to say that MUJ is closing down the gap fast. Most of the things are better at MIT, but there are many things that are better at MUJ too. As a young university, it’s showing great promise and can already boast of remarkable placement stats, an overall good faculty, a plethora of active clubs and chapters, and an awesome coding culture. And remember, there’s an exponential growth in all the above mentioned fields every year. So by the time you graduate, all these things will become even better. MUJ has the backing of the Manipal group, and is also possibly being benefited by the “Institute of Eminence” status of MIT. Apart from this, the Rajasthan Govt. is extending its full support too. This is evident by the setting up of AIC(Atal Incubation Centre) in MUJ. So, there’s nothing to stop it from reaching new heights. Having said all this, MIT is admittedly currently better than MUJ. If you’re getting your desired branch at MIT, go ahead and take it. But if you’re not, MUJ is definitely a good option. A lot of opportunities will be presented to you at MUJ, but it’s up to you to take them, and achieve your goals. Having spent 1 year here now, I’ve seen the rate at which things are scaling up, and the opportunities that are available, and I was amazed and excited at the same time. Because if you want to learn and grow, you’ll find yourself at home at MUJ. The senior-junior equation at MUJ is unlike no other. Everyone is ready to help you. You just have to ask for it. Moreover, the MUJ campus is a “ragging-free zone”. I have never even heard of any ragging taking place here. Adding to it, with all the facilities and resources available in the hostel area, you’ll feel at home in no time. Cheers! (: "

Here's from an excerpt I found: According to my Dad’s professor from NERIST, Anil Sahasrabudhe (currently AICTE Chairman) it will take a minimum of 5–10 years for MUJ to be as good as MIT. He says that looking at the growth it has achieved in a 6–7 years is quite remarkable be it in terms of quality & placements. (Source of the excerpt) You see, MUJ will take a total of 15 years maximum, to reach where MIT took 60+ years. MAHE is putting in amazing amount of efforts into MUJ, by sending professors from MIT, by supplying funds, etc. MUJ also has the backing of Rajasthan government in some form. Also, not to mention, the seniors in MIT don't really care much about the juniors. Whereas, MUJ has probably the most helpful seniors amongst any college in India. If you're willing, you'll get all the help you need, and nothing, believe me, nothing, will stop your growth here. The fact that in just 8 years, this college has an average package of 5.25-5.5LPA, in itself is massive, and speaks volumes. In the past 2 years, the quality of students has bettered substantially. If you want to check the growth of the college, look at the cutoff ranks. For instance, CCE closed at 28k a couple of years back, but closed at 21k last year. Same goes for all branches. Getting admitted into MUJ is getting harder year by year. MUJ is definitely not at the level of MIT yet, obviously. But if you didn't get your desired branch in MIT, and you're getting it in MUJ, I'd say it isn't the end of the world at all. Go for it, work hard, and you'll succeed here. Not to mention, you'll never, ever have problems with settling in or availability of resources in this college, given the amazing infrastructure, and it's North Indian location. Looking forward to seeing you here, soon! ;) "

It's one of the best departments in srm ktr. It has a very highly qualified set of faculties. And compared to many other departments Chemical engineering department is strict in terms of attendance, exams, giving free slots/ free hours. Attendance: almost 90% of faculties would mark you absent if you enter the class after the bell rings, i.e., if you have a class at 8 and if you come by 8:05 or 8:10 they'll mark you absent. And none of the faculties entertain proxy, trust me it's not as easy as you think to put proxy in our department. This is mainly because the department's student strength will be less and within say a week, or two weeks the faculties handling subjects for you would remember you by name and Registration number. Trust me, in other departments take cse, (for example), unless you achieve something very great, faculties won't remember you among the 1000s of students. Exams: So basically, I'd say, cheating in exams is nearly Impossible and I would suggest you to not try that, probably there are people who may try that, but again due to less strength it will be very easy to catch you and they'll totally not tolerate it. Firstly, you wouldn't even need to go to the extent of cheating in exams because the faculties here teach so good. Giving free slots: by the time you come to second year, or let's say in particular from 4th semester you would see many students from other departments chilling out, because they would have been given free slots by faculty, but here, faculties would take up 99% of free slots if possible to take classes. You can take your time to go through the faculties profiles in the website, most of them are from IITs, and have done masters in US, you can also feel free to compare their qualifications with other departments faculties, and you'd find some departments having their heads without a PhD. It has three senior most staffs as well with many years of industry experience. I would say it's one of the most underrated departments in SRM. Nevertheless, in first year none of our department staffs would be handling subjects for you, so whoever handles it and how they handle it, whether or not you get a good experience from faculties in your first year is totally based on your luck. Most important part is about maths, your M3,M4, maths papers that is the maths papers for your second year, will mostly be handled by Prabhakaran sir, he has chosen to stick with our department right after he handled my batch. You will be the luckiest if you get him to handle maths for you. And yeah, chemical students have only 4 maths papers which means you won't have maths after 2nd year unlike other departments. Overall make the best use of the department, it's resources and it's facilities. All the best. "

These above mentioned colleges are extraordinary and have very good placements if you have other choices and you are getting a good rank with a better college then choose one of these.or else join the college which you like choose wise, all the best!

VIT Campus and Hostels are damn safe and guards also cover up a lot of areas near the campus to ensure your security. -We have an amazing cultural fest which comes in the Top 10 fest in India.

This year we had over 950+ placements exclusively for cse students. Placements are really very good.You will get placed for sure if you do a little hard work.Average pay package would be 3.5 lakhs per annum.Another best part is making students INDUSTRY READY.We have PEGA, SERVICE NOW, SAP and SALESFORCE training in the college itself. You can choose any of the above if you’re into that sort. By getting certified in these courses you will have a huge probability of getting placed early.Exclusive clubs for several activities.We have coding clubs if you're into that sort.And the last everything depends upon your hard work alone.Worst part Some of the rules are really worst.You cant enter college without in shirt, shoe and id card.You will be fined 100 immediately if you are not in proper dress code.You will be fined 1000 if you're found using a mobile phone.You have to pay up to 15000 if you're detained in a subject.You have to do 5 certification courses which are nonsense and junk, to be honest. (5k for each course)You will sometimes feel like you’re still in school. :PAnd the list goes on….. :DEvery college has its pros and cons .. I would request you to be extra careful while choosing a college. Because you should not regret joining the same. I have heard that they have raised the college fee to 1.3 lakhs per semester. That’s a huge amount to be really honest. Compare the fee structure with SRM too. Please don’t fall trap for management seat, they will suck the blood out you.

The KTR is little better. InfrastructureThe most important aspect that the SRMites boasts of is their Huge and Well maintained Campus spreading over 250 acres with World Class infrastructure.While this may be somewhat true for the Kattankulathur/the main Campus,the Ramapuram Campus can be brought nowhere into Camparison. The thing that you will mostly do in your 1st year CS in SRM Ramapuram(in case you decide to join SRM) is climb from one floor to another as the lifts don’t work in any building.Mostly during Lab periods, expect to go from the 2nd/3rd floor of Admin Block to 5/6th floor of BMS block which in itself will take around 15 minutes from the class.Now you might even be asked to go to 8th floor of BMS block during VAC(Value Added Course) if you belong to an unlucky section.Coming to the Sports facilities you will find nothing but a Basket Ball Court(which the SRMites call the BBC ground) which is no larger than a local school’s playground.Coming to the Lab infrastructure, they do have system with decent specs and a more than decent wifi but the access to the wifi will be blocked :p The only thing you will be allowed to access is Scilab in your 1st semester and Turbo C++ in second.Hell, I even got scolded for using Dev C++ instead of Turbo C while writing a c code.There is no open wifi networks for the students to use anywhere in the Campus, not even in the Library.Even in the Hostels the wifi is restricted from 4pm to 10pm after coming back from college).Coming to the Library, it is similar to my school’s library which is nothing compared to the huge library building you see at Ktr and it is not even air conditioned.But perhaps it doesn’t concern you,is it?Who cares for a huge library with books numbering in thousands…ultimately it is the quality of books and your level of dedication that matters,right?But perhaps you will be shocked to know that except in your 1st class you will never be taken to the library in the 1st year….nor will you be allowed to issue any books.Yes you heard it right, when I went to issue a book on Data Structures(Yes I knew C language and Java fairly well from before) in my 1st semester, the stuff there straightaway told me that we are not allowed to rent/issue books in our 1st year.The only time I was allowed to rent a book for one night was when I lost my “Chemistry for Engineers” book before my Model exam and that too after pleading a lot to the stuff present there.Now does that concern you?2. Quality of Students Depending on your section(which ranges from A-O for the 2016–20 batch) expect somewhere around 45–65% of your classmates to be from Management Quota.Now don’t get me wrong, that doesn’t imply that you won’t find decent students here or students who are admitted under Management quota are inherently bad.The number of MQ students increases as you go down the range from Sec-A to Sec-O as the MQ guys mostly register themselves during the later dates.That being said, you will find many talented guys, some of them may be good Debaters while some may be proficient in Web Development,etc although finding those hidden talents won’t be easy.There are nearly 1k students in CSE department alone(25 sections*avg of 65 students in one section=975 students).Inspite of this they are increasing the number of students admitted every year. 3. Faculty Despite of their advertisement of having World-Class faculties, I would have been very much happy if they were atleast of National level.Instead most of their so-called world-class faculties graduated from Local Universities like Anna University(that includes even our HOD) , Satyabhama University and Srm University itself. If you doubt my words, check the profile of the faculties from this link: Our faculty The faculties have quite bad temper if you get in their wrong side and their way of teaching is way worse than what you would expect from a college that boasts of such statistics.Most of the teachers lack true knowledge and just skim over the subjects they are teaching you. So many times our teacher stopped in middle of the session because she got confused or didn't know the explanation. Many of the core subject teacher simply dictates from their phones in the class and expects you to copy the same in your Laboratory NoteBook and get it corrected the next day(this includes our 1st year co-ordinator(I won’t mention the name here) who taught or rather dictated us Scilab in our 1st semester).And when you successfully blindly copy the same in your notebook you get this-  (kindly ignore my stupid handwriting and the scribbling at the bottom) You know why I got 7 in the 1st experiment.It’s because I didn’t submit it on time…infact the only criteria that determines your marks is submitting the assignment on time.If you do it you will get full marks, irrespective of whether you copied it from your friends or wrote it correctly. And this is not the end; Now kindly look at these pictures    You know why our co-ordinator who dictated us this course crossed the page and made me rewrite the same…because I was supposed to write the date and experiment number on the top left corner followed by the experiment’s title at the center.And this mistake was committed by more than half of the class.Knowledge in SRM is based on such superficial levels where following orders is more necessary than actually learning subject. God knows what they are trying to make us-engineers or slaves who follows orders blindly. At the end we had to resort to YouTube videos and Scilab help command to do well in our Model exams. Most of your time will be spent on copying from Laboratory textbooks onto Lab Record Note. In Chemistry we had to copy the entire book including the diagrams to be eligible to sit for Model Practical. In Physics and Material Science, around 80% of the class will have the same reading and the teachers will be happy to correct it and award you full marks as long as you get it corrected within their specified time frame. The teacher who was assigned to teach us “Computer Hardware and Troubleshooting” couldn’t tell the meaning of ssd when asked by a student in our second class of 1st semester.And she was supposed to teach us about computer hardware….what an irony! In our 2nd semester, the same teacher was assigned to teach us “Programming Development and Laboratory.”Now this is the subject whose concepts form an integral part of CS engineering.And what approach did she follow-she copied a few programs program from the book related to a specific topic to the board and we were expected to write the same program twice-once in the Lab Record and the second time on the SRM sheets.But the plus point is atleast she tried to make us understand the concept to the best of her ability unlike the guy who taught us Scilab.But what the students mostly do is copy the same program into the machine and most still failed to get the output.Most are not even familiar with the syntax of the language and many can’t even write the simplest of programs like prime,palindrome,etc.And they claim to have completed two programming languages by the end of 1st year-C in 1st sem and C++ in 2nd. At the end of 1st year the students who satistfied the attendance criteria are supposed to get the Certificates of Completion of these languages from our VAC instructor inspite of not knowing even the ABC of the language. But the most horrifying aspect is they prefer quantity instead of quality.In the Second semester our PDD teacher literally told us that unless we write 3 pages or more for 12 marks questions, she won’t give us decent marks.I mean seriously…in coding question she believes the more one writes the better it is…while we were always taught in school that the shorter the code the more optimized it is in terms of space and time(atleast true in most cases). 3. Fests and Cultural Events All the fests and Cultural events are conducted in their Kattankulathur Campus and in order to attend so you have t travel there.Now here comes the catch…during those days(take for example the Milan) the ktr people will have holidays but you won’t so you will have to maintain a really good attendance percentage to be given permission to attend those events as you won’t get any ods from the faculty. After this I come to the less important factors which shouldn’t be the deciding factor while choosing a college: 4. Dress Code Yeah what you heard is true-Boys aren’t allowed to wear Jeans or t-shirts or anything that has a round neck.Collared t-shirts and trousers are a must.Girls must wear Salwars and Kurtis and all such stuffs-no jeans or tops.And you must always wear id-cards inside the campus and if you don’t you will face a variety of problems.The first problem will be from the Security Guards deployed at the gate who understands nothing but Tamil, so good luck explaining them why you forgot it.The next problem will be while entering the building as stuffs are present at every gate to check if you possess the id-card or not.If not, you have to write an apology letter and go through unnecessary troubles.Then in various classes you will get reprimanded from various professors for the same reason :p Arrive late at college and the same thing might happen if you aren’t lucky enough to avoid their eyes.But luckily shoes are not a must :) Coming to the possession of cell-phones,rules are that you have to keep it in switched-off mode inside your bag or do not bring it at all.But you can as well keep it in pocket if you are willing to take a little risk as till date no checking have been conducted.But if you are caught using your phone inside the class, you will face a hell lot of a problem unless you are very lucky to be caught by a kind faculty whose chances are extremely rare.Your phone will be seized and submitted to the co-ordinator’s room.Then you have to write an apology letter(irrespective of whether if you are really apologetic or not) and get it signed from class in-charge,co-ordinator,etc to get it back. So, literally forget about College freedom and enjoyment, if you have any such notions. Now compared to the fees charged the ROI is very less as mostly the students gets placed in mass-recruiter company with an average package of 21–25k per month.But i can’t shade much light here as I am not in that phase yet and told what I heard from Seniors.But if you have the capabilities, you can as well acquire the required skills online from various mooc’s and apply off-campus. Now one can only be interested in joining SRM under these circumstances: Your Father owns a business and you just need a degree to run it.You are absolutely certain you won’t get in iits/nits/iiits/bits/lnmiit/jadavpur etc etc even if you drop a year and prepare seriously.You are happy being recruited by an it company with an average package of 3lpa and you don’t have a problem in shelling out some money.Otherwise,you are confident enough that you can acquire the necessary skills online by dedication and practice without the help of your teachers and you can self-finance your B.Tech without applying for any loan.Conclusion: If you still like the things mentioned above, this place is your heaven. Go ahead! Buy your seat right now. You are a very crucial asset for the university to maintain its TIMES NO. 1 RANKING. Hurry up! The prices tend to increase after a while. "

Truly speaking, I didn’t realize its potential when I was studying in the college but after graduation the reputation of college has helped my startup to grow phenomenally.

The director of Engg and Tech is superb, he sanctioned a mini auditorium for my team to work and research on a project in less than 30 minutes of meeting him. He used to sit himself in the garden to share his knowledge on most of our projects. I have personally seen the zeal in each one of the professor to teach the best and drive innovation in the campus. There are exceptions as well, as all the fingers are not of same size on your hand. They demand respect and politeness. That’s the key. SRM was ranked at No 2 in India for research last year (combined category of both private and govt colleges), to my surprise I saw this list on a banner placed in IIT Delhi and DTU campus in Delhi. If you wanna compare the infrastructure then SRM is better than any of the govt college. Crowd is chill and it’s more fun in campus. Professors really don’t care if you chill around with your GF/BF. But they demand discipline in campus. If you have extra funds then I suggest you to take semester abroad program. "

This will help you a lot in terms of competition faced which will compel you to work hard and improve your skills. Moreover, there is a fear of getting kinda lost in the HUGE crowd at SRM KTR. Secondly, the coding culture of MUJ has grown considerably in past few years. The seniors over here are very helpful, you can always reach out to them for any kind of help. The technical clubs have also improved a lot. For example, MUJ ACM Student Chapter was awarded as second best ACM Chapter in India. These clubs like ACM, IEEE etc will help you a lot in improving your skills by conducting workshops, hackathons, codeathons etc. The research facilities are also very good. Almost every faculty has his/her research work which you can join and publish your own research paper. The faculty is quite good. More than half of them are phd holders. Talking about placements, they are good in both colleges. Companies like Microsoft, Dell, Directi, SAP Labs come in MUJ for campus placements. Again, the smaller crowd present here can help you get placed in your dream company. Thus, I would highly recommend you to chose MUJ. You will have the best time of your life here and will pass out with lots of skills. "

There are many things that you should do outside of your course work if you want a high paying job. 3.) You may have several problems with your roommate at SRM. If you want to switch, then it will be quite difficult, they are very reluctant to switch rooms for students, specially if you don't have anyone to switch with. 4.) Your neighbouring rooms in hostel may play loud music and stuff and your warden may not support your desire for peace. 5.) There are too many examinations at SRM. After a while, you'll be exhausted and may even loose interest in learning and start mugging up things. 6.) There are not many holidays for North Indian festivals. For Durga Puja, we get only 1–2 days of holiday. 7.) If you hate hot weather, then Chennai will be hell for you. Specially, of you take non AC hostel. 8.) Chennai area is prone to experiencing extreme weather conditions. There have been cyclones and floods here. I was here during Vardah Cyclone and it was terrible, we were all scared. I had never seen anything like it. 9.) Most of the students will not be focused towards getting a good career. So your friend circle may affect you in a negative way. You just need to choose wisely for this point though. 10.) We get very short break after semester. My friends in other universities get much longer holidays. 11.) You may regret not knowing the local language at times. 12.) The hostels and mess food are over priced. 13.) The fees is too high. 14.) The food here is too oily. 15.) I don't know how, but you may get skin allergies for the first time here. Me and my friends got some weird skin allergies for the first time and we couldn't even get a proper explanation for those. 16.) If you need to travel to the city, then it'll take 1 hour. 17.) There are too many students here. It may become difficult for you to get recognized by some professor or stuff like that. 18.) There are very few lifts and the crowd is huge. The lift management is good though. You won't have to wait for more than 15 minutes for your turn. 19.) At SRM hospital, mostly students will do your check up and they might not be good at it. 20.) The environment becomes stressful at times. This year 3 people committed suicide here. Every year at least 1 student commits suicide. (There are more than 10000 people here.) And these are the pros: 1.) It is an Institution with a huge, very huge population. The number of people in all the branches is constantly increasing every year. 2.) In CSE department itself number of students in my year are around 1300 and my junior batch has around 1500 students. 3.) Quality of education depends a lot upon the teachers you choose or get for the subjects you have chosen. 4.) One thing that I like about SRM Institute of Science and Technology is that it gives us an opportunity to experience diversity. People here are from all over the India and you can see almost every type personalities here. 5.) Hostel facility is decent and infrastructure is fabulous. 6.) The placements are actually quite good here. 7.) You will get a lot of good exposure to a variety of things which I think is important. Overall SRM is a good college. You'll find that majority of my above mentioned points apply almost to all the colleges. You just need to dig deeper in order to get the information. At the end of the day, you are in control of your life, not anyone else. I have seen several marvelous students coming out of SRM with happy faces, while others cry at petty things. It will be better if you choose a college according to your own taste, comfort level and ambitions. All the best! "

They just want to make big money.A person who hasn't given JEE is also studying there, thanks to the management quota, I mean what will you learn in such enviroment??Nothing, because Surroundings are most important factor in college which contributes to your personality development.There is a old saying: Have genius around you to attract the genius within you because you are the average of your surroundings.  Since not much competitive environment, not much growth is there.But Yess, most of the students decide college is good or bad depending on the placements.So if this is the only factor you want to know then all the three are same enough. You can choose LNMIIT or Shiv Nadar over SRM.So my advice take up the college and from DAY 1, start working on yourself because placements does not depend on college. It depends on your capabilities.Thanks for reading!! Hope this would be helpful!!

They don’t understand that this is their in curriculum so that they can learn things & over come problems in real life when they face any & to give practical knowledge. If you have worked hard for your project, you wouldn’t come up with such doubts. Also by now, you would have already known how good/bad your projects when compared with your mates & reviews by panel so far. Work Hard & Achieve in life.

A normal CSE student can also get into these subjects if they have those ability/knowledge to survive in this area. It’s depends on you to decide which one to choose for your future prospects. So I would suggest check the curriculum in details and then decide to opt one based on your own decision rather asking others opinion. Taking little knowledge is never harm but over knowledge can be harmful sometimes if given by others and you would never find a way out. Please share your decision as well. Good luck.

What I'd like to suggest you is for management quota admission in KTR campus as the seats are left vacant and then distributed on the basis of management quota( for eg I took admission in that college but backed out because I was getting something good and closer to my house in Delhi, so my dropped seat will then be sold on management quota which goes till about 48 LPA according to a relative of mine).

Since the exam was easier so, for sure a higher ratio of people have scored good marks, which leads us to the scenario of ranking in SRMJEEE. This means that the density of the applicants on the top positions is high and a lot of students score the same marks. those who score higher in mathematics are given the top rank, then those with higher marks in physics and if the two are scoring same marks in all fields then the older student is given the preference. So don’t be stressed out in case u have a lower rank. past year analysis of the cut off shows that one with a rank of 10000 can easily get CSE at the main campus of SRM university as a lot of students prefer not to join SRM. Hope this helps. Good luck! "

Join any local/nearby state college, you’ll feel much more contended. Now a long, justified answer, for those having a doubt over my opinion. I am a student of final year, currently pursuing B.Tech from this University. I will trace back my journey from final year, and then leave it up to decide. Back during the joining and counselling time, when I came to Chennai for the first time, I was awestruck by the huge buildings of the campus. I am from a small town, and all these attracted me very quickly. During the counselling, we were made to run from one building of the campus to another building. I was wondering why didn’t they put up the whole admission shit at one place. Poor management has been the college’s forte from a long time I guess. Anyway, this was my first day’s experience of the college. The hostel life was no good. There were some lame rules regarding the wifi, like, it would start functioning only after 6p.m., and only upto 7a.m. I was like “WHAT???!!!”…who does that, they were charging us nearly one lacs for our hostel, and couldn’t even provide wifi for 24 hours. Like this was not enough, all the social networking apps were banned (WhatsApp, Facebook, Instagram, Hike, Viber (Calling App). Still, we managed to use VPNs to access the apps, but the speed was so shitty, that even 1G (had it ever existed) would have worked better than the wifi. Mess food should not even be discussed I guess; we all know what shit they provide at the mess, at every hostel in the country. Coming to academics. The college had one of the shittiest rules anyone might have had ever heard-collared t-shirts/shirts, jeans and shoes are mandatory. One question to the low standard management of the college, WHY? What makes you think that this will bring discipline to the college? One advice, increase the education quality, don’t make some futile rules, nobody respects you all anyway. The faculties are a lot more degraded. They study from this college, and then teach in this college. This tells you how uneducated they are. We were provided books by college for the first 2 years. Most of the boosk were written and published by the faculties of the college itself. Now imagine-studying from SRM, teaching in SRM, then providing the books to the students written by the teachers of SRM. A nursery grade kid could write a better English than these people, kudos to the education of these faculties (or as they would like to call themselves, “PROFESSORS”). The evaluation system was horrible during our time. This is the break-up of the internal marks Cycle Tests (CT) 1 - 10 marks CT 2 - 10 marks Model Exam - 20 marks Surprise Test (Which we knew about a week before, always) - 5 marks Attendance (Yes, trust me!!!) - 5 marks Aaaaand then we had our end sem exam, which had a weight age of 50 marks. So basically, all we had done during our 4 years, is given exams, every damn month. Labs have never been more useless than here. First, we have to make an ‘observation notebook’. Then, we have to copy the exact same thing in a ‘record file’. In Chandler’s way - “Could anything be more useless?” And it doesn’t end here. After writing the record, you have to get the signature of the Lab In charge (who will make you run behind him like you’re his pet), then the HOD (who doesn’t even care to look what’s inside the file), then a stamp from the department office. And what will they do after all this in the University Practical Exam? Punch a hole in the file and give it back to you. You will suddenly have this irresistible urge of ripping the faculty’s body apart and shredding him/her into pieces and feeding it to the stray dogs. Don’t even think of arguing with the faculties. They will make sure that you don’t pass the semester, and will always find an excuse to kick you out of the class, like you’ve been trying sell his both the kidneys (although eventually you’ll wish to do this :D :P ). Once they will find you in some wrong-doing, they will not leave any stone un turned to serve vengeance. The teaching methodology is like something from the medieval period. They will teach you in the dumbest way possible, making the topic all the more obscure, in such a way that the concept will float in front of your eyes in the most haphazard manner. Many seminars, talks, sessions took place in our college. We were forced to attend those, as the faculties had the bait of attendance. They always said that we have to compulsorily attend the seminar, as attendance will be taken there. We knew that nothing as such would happen, still we always fell into this trap, I don’t know why. You all must have heard of the saying - All that glitters is not gold. This fits perfectly for our ‘Fests’. The more they boasted of it to be a grand event, the more hollow it turned out every time. It’s a humble request - don’t ever think of attending the fests. Instead, utilize the 4–5 days’ holiday and just go to any hill-station nearby (there’re many-Coorg, Munnar, Kodaikanal, Ooty are a few to be named). They could’t even welcome John Abraham properly; he was addressed as a “model, and a bollywood actor”. Shame on you, SRM!!! Skipping the sophomore and the 3rd year, jumping straight to the final year, because the nonsense followed suit. This is when you’ll realize how low this college could sink to create a fake impression in front of companies. Infosys was called for a seminar, which the college tagged as ‘pre-placement talk’. And the company came after almost about a month, for the actual placement process. This was done just to make the company feel that the students are interested in their placements. I am from a non CS/IT/Software branch. So obviously I didn’t know anything about coding. We were made to sit forcefully for TCS recruitment process, and were threatened of being removed from the placements if we didn’t attend their training session. Here’s a screenshot of the mail sent by a faculty of mechanical engineeringbranch to its faculties. You can see what kind of sorcery they were doing for us, in the name of ‘helping the students in the placement process’  Now the mail which was sent to us  This was almost a kind of blackmailing. We had no choice but to sit for the placement. And above that, we were made to learn C programming language in 2 days, with a lecture of 2 hours a day. What on earth made them think it was ever possible? So basically, the faculties were deciding in which company we were supposed to sit. Never even my parents had done this, who are they (faculties) to take decision on this subject? Now this is all one person’s view, which is subjective, let’s go in an objective way. Here are some stats Tuition Fees - 1.85 lacs Books Fees - 15 thousand, which just included 6–7 third class quality books, and a drafter and a cheap geometry box, which broke in the first 2 months of usage. We didn’t get the drafter and the geometry box in the 2nd year. CDC Fees - Another 15 thousand, which included only 2 books of Quantitative Aptitude and 1 book on Verbal Aptitude Hostel And Mess Fees - Approximately 98 thousand. A room which was meant for 2 people previously had started accommodating 3 people Laundry Fees - 5/6 thousand (can’t remember it exactly). It was also compulsory, and we were not allowed to give more that 14 clothes in a week, which included only 1 bed sheet. If clothes were extremely, dirty, they would return them without even washing. Many a times clothes were misplaced. Examination Fees - Approximately 2.3 thousand. This is to be paid before every semester exam. Now the hefty fines. ID Card Lost - 1500. By making a DD, they won’t even accept cash. Renewal of ID Card - 1000. Same process Exam Admit Card Lost - 760 If caught cheating/malpractice in the end semester - 10 thousand. All the papers will be cancelled. So to all those people out there, thinking of joining the “Number 1 Private University In India”, please save your parents’ hard earned money, and join any other, I repeat, ANY OTHER COLLEGE IN INDIA, BUT NOT SRM UNIVERSITY.

Rather than suggesting improvements, this is my honest opinion about whatever I've seen here till now. I was an innocent little kid who came to study engineering here so he could become like my hero, Steve Jobs. But today in my final year, I smoke on an average 6-8 joints a day. Now, I'm not blaming anybody. I know that I'm not a bloody genius but how the hell have I never scored a GPA below 7.6? I wonder what sort of education they provide.Placements: I'm studying Electronics and Communication Engineering and I was able to get into a ""core"" company. A lot many companies come to SRM and also offer high packages but don't forget about the previous point. (Most) People here are just not competitive enough to get those good packages. Also, If you opt to sit for placements and you get a job, the college will refuse to give you a Letter of Recommendation if you later decide to study abroad (i.e while you are in college). Well, inspite of being ""India's Number 1 Private University"" most students don't get a package of more than 4 lakhs pa.World Class Infrastructure:   I'll talk about Ramapuram Campus first. There are no drinking facilities anywhere. You'll die of thirst but you won't find water in the water coolers and then the lifts don't work. There aren't even dustbins in the classrooms or in the corridors. When it rains the roof leaks. Lab equipments don't work. AC doesn't work anywhere, not even in the library. I don't know when was the last time money was actually spent on repairs/maintenance. Though SRM people are very proficient in opening new food courts to raise more money. In Kattankulathur campus, they have good marvellous buildings but if you look at them, you'd see that they are only marvellous from on side, and the rest three sides are still under construction. The Tech Park got flooded in the Chennai floods and then it got fire about a week ago. So much for world class infrastructure.I pay 1.5 lakhs pa as my tuition fee and on top of it, I'm being forced to shell out an additional 20-25k pa on placement training and value added courses. First of all, they are not a part of the curriculum. Second, these courses are conducted by institutes owned and operated by SRM (like  Sai Career). Placement Training is compulsory even for students who don't wish to sit for placements and even for people who don't need them. Who is SRM to decide if I need to attend placement training classes or not? And I have to compulsorily buy books from the college book store. There is no grievance redressal anywhere. If you go against the management or the faculty, they'll harass you till the point you lose all your self confidence.Teachers are not world class as advertised.  The Curriculum sucks, it can make you well educated not not talented. The curriculum in no way can help a person who just wants a job. Academics and Vocational Training are two different things. If somebody wants to do well in life, that somebody can't rely on any ""SRM"". I hate the fact that I had to sit and waste my time attending classes given by stupid teachers. My HOD doesn't even have a PHD.When I sat for counselling, there were about 100 seats per stream but when I joined the college, I had 300 students in my batch in my department alone. And then they write on their website that they don't have a management quota. Now, I sit with stupid incompetent people who are only here because they had some extra money on them.SRM in my opinion is a huge money making scam. Mind you, education should be not for profit. SRM here makes people attend stupid placement training classes for the whole four years and now I ask you, can four years of placement training not make you good enough to get a job? But sorry to say, four years of placement training will get you a job, but not skilled enough to stay on the job. Most of the people here still don't know in which field they want to work in. Every year, thousands get placed from SRM mostly for jobs that pay not more than 3.5 lakhs pa and then SRM runs advertisements on all national papers but they don't say how much on an average a SRM graduate earns. Then thousand sit for SRMEEE and then many join SRM. SRM in the end earns a lot of money and nobody has a clue about what it does.This is just my opinion and if you feel that I'm wrong, please, let me know. And if you think I'm right, please let's do something about it. Consumer Court? We've been promised a future and in the name of it, we've only been taken advantage of by these greedy immoral giants.   "

It’s not like that all NITians perform well and getting the good job and same for private institutions vice versa. So here personal opinion always counts and that’s really matter a lot.

Then had to show the letter to my branch coordinator and get it signed and then rush to the exam cell and get a Xerox. I had to pay Rs.100 as fine just to open a website and take a printout. All this accounts for 30 minutes (My physics practicals was for 2hrs) On the way back I was stopped by the OA( First year OA is the most irritating creature in RMK) for having a barely visible beard. He took my ID and forced me to go to the saloon(in hostel ) and get it shaved. Luckily my professor explained the situation that there was only 30 mins left and I was allowed to write the exam ( HAD TO SHAVE AS SOON AS THE EXAM ENDED). There are many incidents like this which happen on a daily basis. Only good thing is the FOOD IS GREAT (barring Monday's worst menu) . To sum up , CSE and IT guys will get placed most often than not in any Engineering college. Easwari and REC are good colleges and have the same placement records as RMK (REC has a better record than Easwari) . The rules are not as bad as the ones in RMK . To sum up , if you wanna enjoy college life and wish to have some freedom of your own , DONT CHOOSE RMK. If you are fine with that , RMK will be the best as academic activities are highly encouraged here and all the faculty at CSE/IT are well experienced .

You can stick to your board exam books but also focus on your core physics and math problems for speed and accuracy both from competitive exam books (which will be important). Use your time wisely.Now, some generic suggestions -Unless you secure a very good rank, CSE will be tough to get because let's face it, nearly everyone aims to get into CSE. IT is also a viable alternative for B.Tech and there isn't much difference in the syllabus or subjects, just the name of the degree tbh. Also, don't worry if you don't get into CSE in the KTR campus but get an option for OTHER campus - I would say go for it! I had a choice between both campuses and elected for KTR because the academics are great and I got to witness the growth of a campus in a tangible way before my own eyes.Plus, if you are really interested in CS as a career choice, you can continue to learn on your own time using resources from the internet such as codecademy, udemy, udacity, tutorialspoint - there is no shortage of resources there.Hope this satisfactorily answers your query.

Among the two, UPES is definitely the right choice. UPES combines legal theory with real-world skills to help its students stay ahead of the curve. Offering six undergraduate and one post-graduate course in law, UPES aims at making the students stay ahead and take the next step. UPES only provides top-notch education, but also focuses on fostering other necessary skills in law students. Law aspirants are likely to learn a lot about networking by studying in UPES. Not to forget, students would understand the dynamics of being a lawyer and most of all become passionate about law. To make the law students confident, UPES also organizes moot court tournaments. Such sessions help the students in sharpening their orating skills while polishing their argument techniques. "

All are give on duty for next fifteen days to work for the celebrations. Initially there was a plan to get lot of sponsorship. Nothing came forward. Then he announced that every student should contribute at least 1000rs. The harassment started to collect money from students and we were told if we do not pay our marks in internals are going to be reduced. The placement officer addressed us and told us if we pay we will get good jobs! Totally 8–9 lakhs are collected. T-Shirts were ordered, prizes were ordered with students money. There was usual fuss that he may not come due to his health and he came by 8.30pm with all his cohorts. That is the first time I have seen him and his talk was most uninspiring. With him there are large number of students also were there, who are also his ijk followers. There was large thumping and shouting. The Dean, Jaishree fell at his feet to get his blessings at the Gate. We were all made to be there in the auditorium. Lady staff are supposed to stay with us. They all disappeared and the hall was half empty. There was no place to sleep and myself and my friends (three of them) slept on the floor. At 1 pm to my horror, I found two hands gripping my breast and groin with smell of alcohol. I found two of the organizers fully drunk doing this to us. Totally schocked by this four of us ran toward out gate. The place was pitch dark and i fell on two seniors enjoying their privacy totally n__ed and there are six couples lying there. I never felt so embarrassed in my life. We rushed to the placement room and found the placement officer fully drunk with two seniors drinking alcohol. My classmate telephoned to her room mate at hostel and we ran to the hostel. We were totally shaken by the experience and I explained this to the dean next day the sequence of events. To my utter horror, she replied coolly that this is a way to learn and get exposure. We went to Deena Ray another organizer. She acted sympathetic to our problem. All of them were awarded with certificates, celebrations and the placement officer, the organizer were heros. The molesters were given special prizes by the Director! The money collected from students is used for alcohol, stuff and food at Java Green for everyday work. The dept was on leave for three days due to the event. This is the way the future generation is guided by Pachmuthu and his henchmen. He is jailed by court and cases are registered against him in innumerable cases relating to money laundering.  "

Some times he will pinch in between legs. His room is in second floor and he will come up to fourth floor. He will again come down and repeat this for four to five times a day. Boys also do it. It is so much embarrassing for us. He will be talking in Tamil in low level language, referring the parts of the girl students to boys. The cheap fellows enjoy his talk about girls. He also checks the ID. It is a way to molest girls. He will touch in between b___ts to find the identity. He once checked my identity and told Monday is longer than Sunday. I did not know it . When i asked him, he told he will tell me at staff room. He told that my breasts are more for my bra. Such is the cheapness of this place. There are three fellows in my class. Mathi, Selvan and Santhosh whose past time is to molest at least one girl in a day. What they do is when we are rushing to the lift for specializations, they will molest us and quickly escape. They will tell other classmates how many they did it! Thank God, I was saved because of some of my good annas who told me all these things and protected me in the second semester.

He collected 3,000 rs for SHAMS. There is no fee for it, but he collected and no receipt was given. Collecting this kind of money by staff is such worst place. For Navarthri celebrations, I was asked to pay 4,000 rs by another staff Balaji. He is class teacher and collects money for nine days dance programme at the department. Lakhs are collected and all the staff share it. It is shame. I never felt that this is an educational institute. Only some of the good teachers like Sri Vidaya Mam, Pradeep sir, Prasad sir, Joe sir and Jothi mam helped me to live in this hell. Project work is another worst thing. We are pressurized to buy from vendors. These people are Anbu and Daniel rajkumar. They get the project for us charge us thousands. No education but money. There is no classes in the after noon for nine days as everyone are compelled to participate in the lobby. The other students stand at the balcony and see the programme. Ponniah one of the dean, will take the event in his i pad and also dance with us. This is the time most of us are molested in the name of dance. No where in the world you will see this kind of institution. We reported to Director and he was very unhappy and he told us that it should be stopped. But the damage to the culture of the place is totally done. "

Continue Reading Having said that the SRMJEE is a lot tougher and more competitive mainly due to the sheer volume of applicants. You can stick to your board exam books but also focus on your core physics and math problems for speed and accuracy both from competitive exam books (which will be important). Use your time wisely. Now, some generic suggestions - Unless you secure a very good rank, CSE will be tough to get because let's face it, nearly everyone aims to get into CSE. IT is also a viable alternative for B.Tech and there isn't much difference in the syllabus or subjects, just the name of the degree tbh. Also, don't worry if you don't get into CSE in the KTR campus but get an option for OTHER campus - I would say go for it! I had a choice between both campuses and elected for KTR because the academics are great and I got to witness the growth of a campus in a tangible way before my own eyes.Plus, if you are really interested in CS as a career choice, you can continue to learn on your own time using resources from the internet such as codecademy, udemy, udacity, tutorialspoint - there is no shortage of resources there. Hope this satisfactorily answers your query. All the best. If your basic concepts are clear you can easily fetch good rank in SRMJEEE 2019. Need Guidance. Ping Me -+917488162565 Hope it helps.

Unfortunately it is somewhat less exciting. The short story is very few PhDs get academic jobs. This article from the Atlantic looks at US NSF data, and the author finds less than 20% of PhDs get academic jobs (across fields). Now onto the crystal ball question... what does the future hold for PhD students? Here is a short list of what I think the future will look like: More holistic training: Given the increasing rate at which we produce PhDs, the labor market will demand broader skills from PhDs and expect more and more preparation for incoming newly minted researchers. So universities will have to train researchers more holistically, including simple things like grant writing classes, presentation classes, journal editorial processes, and similar. Meaning, we will move to actually training people for the job, not just the research.More career guidance: Right now PhDs are basically left to fend for themselves at the end of the degree. This is creating a lot of unhappiness and anxiety in newly minted PhDs. So eventually, this major hole will have to get filled by someone, whether the university or an external body. Helping to place PhDs in jobs where they can apply their skills. I am seeing this happen already in the private sector with cool startups like Oystir - The Best Jobs for PhDs.Even more collaboration during grad school: The levels of collaboration during PhDs is growing constantly. It is already known that collaborations improve the quality and impact of researchers work (see more here). So we will see the PhD students doing increasingly collaborative work!More software tools for PhDs: This is more and more obvious, that research is lagging as an industry in adopting and creating new software and web based tools to increase productivity. We still communicate by word of mouth and group meetings, and write notes in physical books. My own startup OpenLab is a part of this ecosystem trying to improve communication and collaboration within research (do check us out!). Others are doing cool things as well, like TetraScience, creating an IoT platform for labs. These tools will easily make PhDs 5-10x more productive than they are today. Just like what software tools do for business today compared to 10-15 years ago.Fewer PhDs overall: Sadly, the feedback of employment difficulty after a PhD will eventually mean that we will see a slow down in PhD enrollment and eventually a reduction. Essentially, a correction in the labor market for PhDs has to happen soon. This is especially true given the rise in postdocs everyone knows too well. Please follow and share for more answer. "

Colleges that did not provide factual information were not ranked. ” Therefore, this survey is not entirely based on facts but perception also. Additionally, institutions which did not allow their students to vote only on the parameters which are set by Neilsen (most probably because the institutions thought the parameters were really vague / not circumspect enough to provide an accurate image of the institution) are NOT included in the survey.Since this is a perception survey, there are also problems of bias such as Desirability bias or Acquiescence bias, A student studying in an institution is more likely than not to rate the quality of infrastructure/education of that institution higher than it actually is (It further looks like Neilsen did not actually do anything further to get ‘factual’ metrics for the various parameters of the survey).Finally, the survey only considers Top Engineering institutes in India - and how they determine which institutions to survey? That is a secret only Neilsen knows. (I am willing to bet they consider IISc a science institution rather than an engineering one. If not, I am surprised it is not #1 in the list).All this said, SRM is still one of the better universities in India. Although it does not compare to the likes of IIT in terms of Student-Body/ Funding/ Faculty, it tries to make up for them in the form of career-opportunity, Diversity, infrastructure.

In my time at SRM, I have experienced many instances of misuse of power from both faculties and management; not to mention numerous other accounts that I have heard from others. But, being the massive powerhouse they are, most of these accounts don't see the light of day. Any student, past or current, who saw the videos circulating of the management’s response to the incident will no doubt attest to the fact that that was a typical reaction from their side. The faculty and staff enjoy immunity from a management that puts far more significance on institutional face-value and reputation over student wellfare. I even saw a live video of an open-house meeting between representatives of management and students held at TP Ganesh Auditorium where the dean had the audacity to comment, “You will be the ones who suffer because you protest.

Tell me one state in India which is safe for your son or daughter or friends. Indian people don't realise how big is this issue until or unless something happen to them or their relatives. They will assume them self as the luckiest person in the world. They believe nothing can happen wrong to them. But they are ignoring the fact that life can change in one moment. Today it happened in SRM, Tomorrow it will happen in Delhi, in Mumbai, next day in your state. Tell me why are we living in here?? Instead of finding the solution we only post questions. Instead of helping the victims we make them feel as they are wrong. Instead of punishing the wrong person we are letting them go. What are we doing. We are just hoping that :OK it happened in Delhi but nothing will happen to us, it happened in chennai (in this case SRM) but that's OK it will not happen to us. Nothing will change until we all do something from now on, nothing will change by publishing few news or articles. If we do nothing now sooner or later you will be the victim. Analysis of case in SRM A 28 years old lift mentanance man masterbate in front of a girl. This can happen in any girls hostel as most (lift mentaner) of them are male. ( The man is been arrested, SRM helped the victim. In short we need to take a step forward. Or we can wait for some knives to cut as apart. Anonymous because I know no one will take this issue seriously. I know after reading this again you will play “kissmat ka khel” (game of luck) But believe me all this issue, all this cases can be solve if from now on we take some action. We got 2 choice how we want India to be in 2025 Much bad even then the worstSafest country (in all aspects)I leave it to you. But I want 2nd option. How each and everyone can contribute 1)Tells girls that they are not weaker the boys. 2)Girls can fight with boys too and they can win. 3)Teach boys from birth how to respect women and same goes for girls. 4)Girls should know some self defense techniques.

I would recommend looking for a case that at least has a top exhaust and room for 2 120mm fans in the front if possible. Most of the cheap options will be atx mid towers most likely, but they will probably be your best bet. I believe there are a few good options in the 50–60 dollar range. If you really need the micro atx size, you may be able to find something to fit your needs, but I don't know how much there is at a low price point. I know cheap stuff sounds great, but moving up from the $30 range to the 50–60 dollar range can really have a big impact on your system, and in the grand scheme of things shouldn't be too much more expensive. It's up to you though, so if that's what you want to do, I think it would be possible. I just haven't seen anything to confirm this. "

Third category contains some students who are into some bad habits like smoking, drinking and so on. These are the type of students with who you wouldn't generally like to be considered as. They usually have a lot of arrears or at best they barely pass their exams and have an average CGPAs.

Placements depends equally on luck, hard work and determination. Luck is not in our hand so focus on hard work and determination. Usually two types of companies come for placements in SRM: Service based and Product Based. Service Based: TCS, Wipro, Hitachi Consulting and other consulting firms come under this. They test ur logical, analytical, verbal and aptitude skills. So prepare accordingly for them. Refer to the aptitude book provided by SRM or RS Aggarwal to enhance ur aptitude skills. Several online courses and tests are also available. Product Based: Amazon, Cisco, Aruba are a few companies to name. They offer comparatively higher CTC than service based. Mostly prefer people having good technical knowledge as well as logical skills. So, focus on Data Structure, Networks and Operating Systems. Also improvise your coding skills ( preferably Java as it implements OOPS concepts in lesser intricate pattern. You can also resort to C++). Refer geeksforgeeks [1] and hackerrank [2]for it. Also take help of the ppts shared by our professors in all these years to brush up the concepts.

For these people, life here at SRM CSE is really pleasant with faculties being very friendly in terms of scheduling the classes as well as giving good marks. You always have one extra hour given per week for most of the courses which can be used as compensatory classes in case class is lagging behind or it can be cancelled. So we end up somehow getting classes cancelled when we want them to as per our convenience. If you are more into research and academic things, even then you will find that most of the faculties have some research experience or would be working on some projects or other and they would be quite eager to take you in for the project. As far as the placements are concerned, students of CSE department got a lot of dream offers in the ongoing placement season and 75–80% of the students who opted for placements are already placed with many of them getting 5–12 lpa as starting package itself. The mass recruiters also took a lot of students who got 3–4lpa package. So overall placements have been really good here.

I will try to list out some of your answers you might have thought by yourself.. 1.Placements: 1st thing that should have struck your mind might be to get a decent percentile during your course years in order to sit in placements & then grab a exciting package. so let me tell me if you solely working for getting placements & belong to CS, IT or ECE department in your college then don't even think about preparing for JEE. SRM KTR has very good Placement records in these branches & the college will provide you enough exposure which will help you to find a nice job. 2. Further Studies: If you planning to pursue higher studies like M.Tech, MS, CAT etc. Then irrespective of the branch you are having you can think of preparing for JEE exam. Target for Top NIT’s only then only it will make any sense of the decision you made for preparing JEE Mains for the 3rd time, moreover you also get good mentoring & guidance from your teachers for clearing the exams for these entrants. 3. Government Job: The last but not the least according to me will be preparing for exams of government jobs like UPSC, SSC, PO etc. So for this also your college won't matter anymore but preparing for JEE in this condition might result in lose of your 1 precious year as there are only limited attempts & there is strict age limit criteria also. .. So finally summing everything it isn't a good idea for preparing for JEE Mains again & if I would have been your place I shouldn't have even thought of preparing and taking the risk, but still if you are determined & optimistic for getting a good result then start preparing for JEE right from now Friend because there is not much time left, the clock is ticking..!!

This year the criteria was 60–60–60 in all 10 ,12,eng with no standing arrear so the is a chance with much less effect. "

Mass recruiting companies like TCS, Infosys ask for 60% in both 10 & 12 whereas core companies may ask 70/75 or even 80% percent in either of the two or both. Some companies even ask for 90% in 12th but those are very few. Most of the companies' eligibility criteria falls between 70–80% in 10 or 12th or both.. Also as the competition is very high, the companies try to eliminate as much students as possible so if you do not clear the eligibility criteria you will not be allowed to sit nor you can argue about it. It's better to stay on the safe side.. Cheers :) "

Ncc is hard but if you want to opt out. Value education is all about your English skills and some basic knowledge would do.

So, I am at much liberty to explain in detail the atrocities students face in this college. Okay, what do you look for in a good college? Good infrastructure, education, technology, placements etc. First of all Chuck all that! Don't even expect the college to provide you clean drinking water or clean restrooms. I'm a 2016 pass out and the CSE department used to be much less crowded like we had hardly 250 people in our batch. Most of the times, the water purifier will not be working and there will be no water to drink. You must carry water from home (luckily my home was quite close) to stay hydrated throughout the day. There was this one time we found a worm in the drinking water and when we complained to the floor in-charge, she promptly whisked away the bottle. She said the problem is being looked into and returned an empty bottle (not that we are going to upload it online or something but the things these people do to cover up stuff). 70% of the time, the restrooms will be stinking and the yucky smell will be gracing the classrooms too. And the best part they will lock the restrooms promptly by 4. I mean, is somebody gonna steal something from there? Food (poor hostellers!)- this one is from them. Though they paid 80,000 mess fees (in 2016, I'm not sure about the fees now), most of them ate food from outside. There was an infamous video on worm infested tea can being used to serve tea in the boys hostel. And 90% of hostellers start living outside from 2nd year to save money paid (rather wasted) as hostel and mess fees. Now that we have covered about your basic needs, let's move to why you are actually there. Education: Books: They will steal money in the name of book fees right under your nose. Rs. 15,000 for some 20 books, 5 records and an E.G set. The best part? None of the books were from the given syllabus. We protested and started buying books on our own from 3rd sem.Faculty : 90% politics, 10% knowledgeable. Very very few professors are actually knowledgeable. Rest are just there to torture you to show other faculty that they are being strict, prim and proper. If you talk back, you might as well sign your death warrant. You'll have to beg them, pacify them blah blah for them to sign your records. Oh how many times they will make you walk back and forth for that dumb record! Rumors fly people! The faculty are more kiddish than the students. And don't wait up for somebody to teach you. No one will. Take a print out of the syllabus paper. Rush to the library. Pick up the needed books. Start learning. Don't expect any faculty to teach you new programming languages or something. You ARE on your own.Labs: Oh! Our good ole' computer labs. Hardly 10–15 systems worked properly among the 60 or so systems in a lab. Be ready to share.Infrastructure : Dude! Have you seen the cracks on the buildings? And the ongoing construction work? Be ready to navigate among the steel rods, cracked roads, swamp created during and after rain. Don't be fooled by the look of admin office. It's the only decent looking building in the campus. The CSE block has 8 floors of which 7 floors have classrooms. There's only one lift. You might as well start climbing the stairs. Oh, no playground and be ready to navigate from one block to another for VAC class. Placements: The ultimate reason why people fall into this crappy institution. My batch is the last one to be a part of placements held in KTR campus. That 1000 something companies come there only. Now, SRM Ramapuram is no longer a part of those placements. So, basically you'll be attending your placements with Easwari people and I'm very sure not so many companies come. And that 100% placements record? If you are not placed by the end, you'll be forced to take up BPO job offers so that they can maintain their record. Dress Code: Subject to changes by the floor in-charge. If they are in a good mood, kurti and leggings are allowed. If they are having a bad day, they will literally call you and scream at you for wearing tight clothes. If you are a hosteller, they will ask you to go change and then come attend the classes. What have I learned in the 4 years? Well, I have learned to educate myself, to handle tough people and tough situations. My patience level has gone up after these 4 years. And I did meet and network with a lot of people. Your interpersonal skills will see a boost. DISCLAIMER : These are my personal experiences. Please note that this happened 1–2 years back. Things might have changed (though I highly doubt that) now. And do keep in mind that 60–70% of private engineering colleges have these same problems. Some colleges don't even have placements. So if you are not getting seat in a govt. colleges, "

Now, I'm not blaming anybody. I know that I'm not a bloody genius but how the hell have I never scored a GPA below 7.6? I wonder what sort of education they provide.Placements: I'm studying Electronics and Communication Engineering and I was able to get into a ""core"" company. A lot many companies come to SRM and also offer high packages but don't forget about the previous point. (Most) People here are just not competitive enough to get those good packages. Also, If you opt to sit for placements and you get a job, the college will refuse to give you a Letter of Recommendation if you later decide to study abroad (i.e while you are in college). Well, inspite of being ""India's Number 1 Private University"" most students don't get a package of more than 4 lakhs pa.World Class Infrastructure: I'll talk about Ramapuram Campus first. There are no drinking facilities anywhere. You'll die of thirst but you won't find water in the water coolers and then the lifts don't work. There aren't even dustbins in the classrooms or in the corridors. When it rains the roof leaks. Lab equipments don't work. AC doesn't work anywhere, not even in the library. I don't know when was the last time money was actually spent on repairs/maintenance. Though SRM people are very proficient in opening new food courts to raise more money. In Kattankulathur campus, they have good marvellous buildings but if you look at them, you'd see that they are only marvellous from on side, and the rest three sides are still under construction. The Tech Park got flooded in the Chennai floods and then it got fire about a week ago. So much for world class infrastructure.I pay 1.5 lakhs pa as my tuition fee and on top of it, I'm being forced to shell out an additional 20-25k pa on placement training and value added courses. First of all, they are not a part of the curriculum. Second, these courses are conducted by institutes owned and operated by SRM (like Sai Career). Placement Training is compulsory even for students who don't wish to sit for placements and even for people who don't need them. Who is SRM to decide if I need to attend placement training classes or not? And I have to compulsorily buy books from the college book store.There is no grievance redressal anywhere. If you go against the management or the faculty, they'll harass you till the point you lose all your self confidence.Teachers are not world class as advertised. The Curriculum sucks, it can make you well educated not not talented. The curriculum in no way can help a person who just wants a job. Academics and Vocational Training are two different things. If somebody wants to do well in life, that somebody can't rely on any ""SRM"". I hate the fact that I had to sit and waste my time attending classes given by stupid teachers. My HOD doesn't even have a PHD.When I sat for counselling, there were about 100 seats per stream but when I joined the college, I had 300 students in my batch in my department alone. And then they write on their website that they don't have a management quota. Now, I sit with stupid incompetent people who are only here because they had some extra money on them.SRM in my opinion is a huge money making scam. Mind you, education should be not for profit. SRM here makes people attend stupid placement training classes for the whole four years and now I ask you, can four years of placement training not make you good enough to get a job? But sorry to say, four years of placement training will get you a job, but not skilled enough to stay on the job. Most of the people here still don't know in which field they want to work in. Every year, thousands get placed from SRM mostly for jobs that pay not more than 3.5 lakhs pa and then SRM runs advertisements on all national papers but they don't say how much on an average a SRM graduate earns. Then thousand sit for SRMEEE and then many join SRM. SRM in the end earns a lot of money and nobody has a clue about what it does.This is just my opinion and if you feel that I'm wrong, please, let me know. And if you think I'm right, please let's do something about it. Consumer Court? We've been promised a future and in the name of it, we've only been taken advantage of by these greedy immoral giants.

We belong to a rare breed. Cyberspace is a wonderful place to discover like-minded friends.Congratulations indeed. Please note that the timeline of this wonderful naturalist was the first half of the twentieth century, and from the story it appears that the Ramapuram man-eater operated in the nineteen twenties or thirtees. Coimbatore, north Coimbatore more so is a gateway to the Nilgiri hill station of Ooty or Udhagamandalam, parliamentary constitution of S Raja, infamous for 2G scam. The plains are lush green. At the foothills greens give way to sparse vegetation interspersed with rocky areas and some streams. Ramapuram from its description appears to be situated in lower slopes of the foothills. In those days it was a tiny hamlet, inaccessible and remote. Being in the foothills rains should be heavy, yet summer should not be that savage as in the plains of South India. Ooty is pretty chilly, lovely place though in off-season. The coffee plantations are panoramic. The tiger would have operated in the scrub jungles, along the stream beds and jungle paths winding through bamboo groves and undergrowth. Somewhere dense, somewhere sparse, somewhere rock-strewn approach to isolated hamlets like to Ramapuram must have been a daunting task. To the poor, helpless villagers that tiger must have been a nightmare. Sparse population, inhospitable jungles provided the tiger freedom to roam unchallenged and strike at will. Please excuse me for a rather long response. "

Finishing school program is offered by the Institute for students to prepare them for all kind of interviews and aptitude tests. In-house internships are also offered which helps freshers to boost their experience. Additional advantage of KJSIEIT over any other engineering college in mumbai is that KJSCOE is an autonomous college so obviously companies coming there are better and well-known, as placement pooling is done between KJSIEIT and KJSCOE, students from KJSIEIT get a chance to apply for those companies too.

The important thing is that they won't provide you internal marks. You cannot get easy 20 internal marks like in other colleges. They would conduct three tests and based on the average of those three tests they provide your internal marks. Getting 20 internal or even 0 lies in your hand. Talking about the placement, I heard the placements has been increased after the autonomous grants. Not sure about that though. The placements were low during my time and not upto the mark. The only major placement happened in my time is Accenture and it's a bulk placement. Being a Valliammai student and placing in Accenture is a bed of roses but if you miss that opportunity there won't be any rescue companies to save you, atleast in my time. Not sure about the current status. Canteen food would be good and as I am a hostellate there, I can also say the hostel facilities are also good and neat. In simple words, liberal college, good teaching, neat lab facilities, slightly low placement (in my time), tidy canteen and hostel. "

Orientation: Before the commencement of classes, we have orientation programmes at the auditorium. The first day at the college is held in mid August (mostly) and the teachers usually begin teaching their subjects without wasting much time on the introduction part. First week of college is for induction where you have to spend half of the day listening to boring lectures from dignitaries. Introduction: You get plenty of time to settle down before the actual classes starts. Then comes the ice breaking sessions where you get to know your fellow batch mates. Then starts your lectures where faculties guide you about exams,rules and everything. Seniors are very cooperative. Interaction with VC: There is also motivational interaction with the VC and they introduce to the various clubs and groups working in the campus.Other than that ,basic interactions, better mess food, new Whatsapp groups and hostel celebrations are done. hope this information helps you.

The management needs only money it doesn’t care about the welfare and growth of students. Placement division of CVSR is the worst I have seen of all the “so called” top colleges in the state. By the way it doesn’t feature in genuine list of top 10 colleges in Telangana. The same may not hold true for CMR main campus but it is advisable to take a better college.If you still prefer one of these colleges, I prefer CMR main campus. Edit:Don’t look for the best among worst colleges.Aim for the best among best colleges. Note: Please take reviews from multiple final year students before joining any college. "

Because I am studying in cmrcet which is the first campus of cmr. I think according to the placement u should go for cmr . Also in cmr u have many activities for your personality development. Cvsr is also good but as placement wise cmr has more grip. But cse is the best branch u will learn the same thing in any college ur coding or other things will depend on ur hardwork But guys being frankly I think college doesn't matter if u have talent.

Almost all of such books will be new because only a few B.Tech students study from them.Moore Market, a 2 minute walk from Chennai Central railway station which is purely a books and stationery market where you can find all sorts of books related to your field.

So answering your question, it depends on the faculty. Senior faculties won't give you any such advantage but you can use this as a means to create a friendship with the faculty which will help you in getting good marks if you choose that faculty for one of the subjects. Besides, if you are a student of katankulathur campus, then the faculty can also help you providing information about other faculties in the department which is useful when you do the faculty selection.
