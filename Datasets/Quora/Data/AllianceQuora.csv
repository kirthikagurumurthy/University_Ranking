Infact, akin to the JOSAA counselling , there is a common COMEDK counselling for several colleges in Bangalore. However there are a few colleges like PES, that have their own entrance exams( PES hosts the exam PESAT).PES takes admission via COMEDK also, but students via COMEDK will be alloted the SOuth campus only and not the main campus of PES. My advice to you is give as many entrance exams as possible . Hope everything works out well for you. "
