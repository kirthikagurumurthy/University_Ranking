Why has PESU scored such a low ranking in the NIRF 2020? Most of the other Bangalore colleges have obtained a higher ranking.,"The reason their ranking has dropped is that they have started using their proprietary exam system, the PESAT. The PESAT is a premier exam in the state of Karnataka, however, the discrepancies between the rankings students acquire in PESAT and government exams such as the COMEDK are huge. Since the NIRF does not have a base metric to judge the admittance in PESU due to the PESAT, their ranking has plummeted."
Why is the highest package offered at NIT Surathkal lower than RVCE and PES University in B.Tech CSE placements?,"I don’t know about the highest package in RVCE or NIT Suratkal but I can definitely tell you that packages are nothing to do with how good a college is.We hear a lot of news of people bagging some crores package in IIT’s or some other reputed college. This make us think that package relates to the quality of the college you study. Although you cannot directly decline this hypothesis but this doesn’t works all the time.Don’t focus over placements , no matter how bad a college is there will be always a bright student there who will work his ass off and bag that lucrative package you always dreamed. So just choose one and work hard to learn."
Why is the highest package offered at NIT Surathkal lower than RVCE and PES University in B.Tech CSE placements?,"Nope, this is not true. You can say that the highest packages mentioned in the placement brochure of NIT Surathkal may be lower than the highest packages of the colleges you mentioned. In placement brochure, only those packages and offers are mentioned which are offered by companies visiting the campus. The best coders of NITK do not even attend the placement process. They already have hefty job offers even before placement season begins, so they really don't have to attend the placement process of NITK. In my batch, two of the top coders got placed in Google Zurich office after internship program which they got after GSOC. There are many more such example.P.S. : Highest domestic package of NITK during 2017–2018 placement season was 38 LPA by Uber. So, I think you need to verify your facts again."
Why is the highest package offered at NIT Surathkal lower than RVCE and PES University in B.Tech CSE placements?,"Because the placement stats published by any Indian engineering college is NOT accurate and honest.NIT-Trichy, Surathkal, Warangal = Tier-1RV and PES are fraud tier-4 Indian engineering colleges."
"Does PESU RR campus offer minors in management-related courses? If so, what details are available in this regard?","Yes, PESU RR does provide minors in management related courses like finance etc. I have a very limited knowledge since some of my classmates are enrolled in it. They both have taken a course in finance. While the semester is ongoing we can take only one minor subject instead of 2 in summers.The timings are very relaxed. Its thrice/twice a week for 2hrs a day. Internal assessments and esa is also there. Its taken after college ends. According to them, it has not been a very burdensome subject to take on.Minor courses are offered from 1st year onwards, notices are put up everywhere on how to register for a minor course, how forms should be filled and the fees paid."
"Which is better for CSE, Nirma University or PES University?","Bruh! Can you hear yourself?If someone asks you in the future where did you graduate from, you gonna reply ‘I graduated from Nirma University’?What is the college's motto? -Doodh ki safedi Nirma se aayi, rangeen bache bhi khil khil jaye, Nirma se baandha samaa???Ghar bhar ke bacho ko pal mein nikkhaareHema, Rekha, Jaya aur Sushma!

The syllabus is also tailored to meet the latest industrial requirements. Every year the syllabus is updated. So its a very simple decison to choose PESU over Nirma."
"Is the entire annual fee of PES University taken all at once every year, or is it taken semester by semester?",The entire annual fee is taken all at once during the start of every new academic year. The time to pay is generally from June 15th to August 20th (may need to confirm). After that late fee charges gets added.
Is it possible to shift branches from EEE to ECE after the first year at PESU?,"Hey there!It is quite possible to shift but it largely depends on the number of seats left , number of people and your CGPA. You need to be among the top 5% of your batch to achieve this. You need to remember that there will be diploma students as well in this raceDuring the beginning of my second year, we had a few transfers from mechanical, and ig 1â€“2 from EEE.Anything you imagine is possibleSo stay safe, study hard and don't be disappointed if you don't get it ! The world is your oyester, seize it :)"

What has PES University's response been with regards to exams during the COVID-19 pandemic?,"The response from the administration has not been very clear. In their most recent announcement, they promised they would announce the exam schedule 2 weeks before they are to take place. However, no clarity was offered on the mode of examination.If the exams are going to be held offline, it would jeopardise the safety of students, particularly those using public transport. Since COVID-19 is asymptomatic, thermal checks can not guarantee that a person is not infected.Additionally, COVID-19 cases in India are expected to peak in July or August (Links here :India's coronavirus cases peak yet to come: AIIMS DirectorTop WHO expert's warning: India faces risk of coronavirus explosionCovid-19 peak likely in July-August: Dr SK Sarin )Conducting offline exams in July or August would seem to be out of the question. Online classes conducted by the college were good, but doubt clearing was an issue, as is the case with any online learning platform. Due to bandwidth issues all across India, Internet speeds weren't good for many students, leading to disturbances in the video/audio quality. The same Internet issues could crop up while giving the exams, if conducted online.Deputy CM of Karnataka Dr. Ashwat Narayan recently spoke about offline classes being held before the exams to help the students. This would be more ideal than keeping the exams directly although this comes with its own set of issues with regards to the academic calendar.Some colleges like NIT Warangal and Manipal Institute of Technology have followed the UGC guidelines of evaluating the result using the performance in internals and assignments.Hopefully the college administration comes up with a more clear and concise plan as soon as possible to reduce the pressure on students during this worldwide epidemic."
What has PES University's response been with regards to exams during the COVID-19 pandemic?,"I believe the college is waiting for the government's response to conduct exams or not. Recently, a survey was conducted where many students filled out answers to the questions as to where they stay and is it viable for them to come from their native states to Bangalore to write exams. The college had responded to it appropriately.Personally, I want the college to conduct exams and not promote us based on previous internal marks or previous year marks. It would be unfair to the people who couldnt perform well last time for some reasons. They lose a chance to increase their cgpa which decides their life/ career.I think the college should conduct exams for the 6th semester students and for final year students. The rest can be promoted. As it is important for the immediate placement season.But how they conduct the exams will be a problem. How they do it and when they do it.I am in Bangalore itself and living near PES university. There has been no cases here and since the lockdown was lifted 80% of the people dont wear masks and dont follow social distancing. So i think it will be very dangerous for people here and the students coming from interstate travel to contact the virus.Many students who have answered this question have written that online classes havent been effective. I dont believe that. Atleast for my semester, the online classes were conducted admirably and the doubts were cleared really well. The teachers kept asking for feedback and kept explaining a topic if the student asked for it again. It was better than offline classes for some subjects. And for revision also many teachers discussed and explained previous year question papers. Overall a good experience.Even if students couldnt watch it online at that time due to data issues, 2 months are more than enough to catch up on that. The recorded videos are still in impartus.Bottom line is, I want to write the exams but how and when it happens will be a concern. Just hope that no corona cases come up."
What has PES University's response been with regards to exams during the COVID-19 pandemic?,"All pes has done is give an answer they pulled out of their ass that doesn't ease anyone's stress or clear anyone's doubts about exams. They gave a response for the sake of giving one.And to me, the online classes didn't work out and I stopped watching half way but I know people whom it worked out for. But I think the majority will agree it didn't work out for them or they haven't been able to access it because of data problems. So I find it stupid that pes is even considering keeping exams and adding stress to students during a global pandemic but I think they'll keep exams regardless.It's obvious that they won't be keeping offline exams and will probably keep online exams but if the management isn’t brain-dead they'll realise it's better to just promote all students except final years."
What has PES University's response been with regards to exams during the COVID-19 pandemic?,"First of all CoVID cases have been continuously increasing and experts say it will peak in July…secondly hostelites students from PES are from all over the country the transportation is ridiculously expensive and highly unsafe right now.And with so many people in the hostel it’s highly unsafe and also too many at the hostel mess too.I heard the exams will be conducted in slots from 7–7 , but what about the students who use public transport? Metro is shut and BMTC is not fully functional and it’s not even safe after all.Regarding the online classes it has not been very effective for some subjects.But until now there’s no proper response from college , as PES is a university it doesn’t have any necessity to depend on VTU’s order nor the government order as MIT cancelled exams too.I would just like to question what if even one student gets the virus attending college? (Maybe in the hostel,transport,mess,PG,examination hall) will college take responsibility for it? Please value our lives and promote us."
What has PES University's response been with regards to exams during the COVID-19 pandemic?,"PESU's response with regarding the conduction of exams has been unclear and confusing. One of the internals was cancelled as the college was in lockdown.Instead of the second internal the college had given more assignments for evaluation. As of today, the college has not given any confirmation with regard to the end-semester examination.Though the students have been told that there will be a 2-week notice before the examination begins.But this response is not satisfactory as the students are still confused whether the exam will be held or not. There have been several requests by the students for the cancellation of the exam. For this as well there has been no clear response.The college seems to be deciding on how to conduct the exam instead of whether to conduct the exam or not."
What has PES University's response been with regards to exams during the COVID-19 pandemic?,"Most of the stuff has been covered in previous answers.The college being autonomous,did a good thing by not conducting the second internals and instead focusing on assignments. However,with claims of the college being at par with the IIT’s , they could follow what the premium institutes like IIT’s ,MIT did, and not hold final exams,for the 2nd 4th and 6th sem .It can do so more easily than other colleges in Karnataka as it is autonomous. PES is a reputed college,attracting students from all over India, so when travelling is such a big issue, it does not make sense to call students to give exams.The least the could do is confirming what they r planning at the earliest,so that the students simply don’t waste their precious time.Hope that a decision is taken soon."
What has PES University's response been with regards to exams during the COVID-19 pandemic?,"From the news which I got from professors and students, it seems like PESU will be conducting exams irrespective of the current situation. PESU just wants to decide if it is online or offline.Now if it wants to conduct exams offline, people from almost all over the country should be traveling, which is not a safe option as students might get in contact with the virus and by doing this they will be spreading the virus even more.And the online option is not very feasible, due to the lack of stable internet connectivity for some students. And a lot of students couldn’t attend the online classes due to the same reason.So a viable option is to cancel the exams and promote us based on the ISA’s, assignments, and projects. And it would be better for the students if PESU responded as soon as possible."

What has PES University's response been with regards to exams during the COVID-19 pandemic?,"The management till now has not given a correct decision on the ESA's, about 3 days the management sent a notice that they are going to conduct examinations, that too saying they will issue the time table shortly and no other information we're given in detail.As the notice focused more on the final year students of the university, they dint mention any decisions being taken on the intermediate semesters and also told 2 weeks prior to the examinations they'll let us know, this 2-week idea is ridiculous as students have to travel and must be under quarantine, and seeing the current situation, I request the management to take appropriate decisions, keeping students interests in mindAnd finally in case if they are sure about conducting exams, offline classes must be conducted 2-3 weeks prior to the exams."
What has PES University's response been with regards to exams during the COVID-19 pandemic?,"There has been no proper information given by PESU regarding the examination. It is really confusing for the students whether to study for the examination or not.The online classes which were held helped,but not to great extent because most of the students did not have the proper resources, and most of the student weren't able to follow the topics .A major concern for the students is traveling if the examination has been conducted by the College as most of the students travel in public transportation.Taking public transport in this situation is very risky and unsafe.I request the management of PESU to look into the matter,and inform the students as soon as possible whether the examination is going to be held or canceled."
What has PES University's response been with regards to exams during the COVID-19 pandemic?,PES should also take an honest opinion from the parents on the conduction of exams. As most of the parents are more concerned about the exponentially increasing rate of COVID-19 cases and not want their children to get exposed to this environment.They should also note the fact that many students take public transport as a result high chance of them getting infected. Therefore all the conditions are unfavorable for the institution to hold the exam.I personally think it wouldn't be smart for PESU to put on hold- the exams currently because of the obvious health risk and the fact that many students cannot come from different states
What has PES University's response been with regards to exams during the COVID-19 pandemic?,"Due to the coronavirus pandemic lot of things are uncertain. Recently a VTU student got infected with covid-19 while Travelling from Chennai to bangalore. Like this way, this may be the fate of many students across the globe. Also conduction of offline classes is highly impossible now.The HRD minister Dr. RP Nishank has directed the state govt to take a decision on promotion of university students except the final years. As it is a clear green signal from the central Government, I request the PES University to come up with a fair decision very soon and I hope it will be as per UGC which is promotion"
What has PES University's response been with regards to exams during the COVID-19 pandemic?,The University has neither been quick nor clear in giving a response with regard to exams.The students have been told that they will be informed 2 weeks prior to the conduction of the exams but this still hasn't provided any clarity on whether the exams are going to be conducted or not.Students are currently stranded in all parts of the country and it is very stressful to them as they are studying endlessly .Added to this is the risk of traveling not just to the exam center but also across the country in order to get back to Bangalore.The situation is just getting worse everyday but it seems as though the university is neglecting that part to a great extent .Hopefully the students will be informed not just 2 weeks prior but as soon as possible about the conduction of the exams with surety as this confusion is not helpful in these already difficult times.
What has PES University's response been with regards to exams during the COVID-19 pandemic?,"The University hasn't given any clarity on this!Looks like it will not cancel exams,When Universities like VIT , MIT and also IIT'S AND NIT'S have promoted intermediate semester students it's dissapointing to see PES to go ahead with conducting exams without being considerate towards students problems and future!Wish students at PES and also other private colleges in Karnataka meet a logical end and get promoted as being done by many premier institutes of India keeping in mind whatever we have done in previous semester and internal assessment of this semester!I'm going anonymous for obvious reasons!Thank you!"
What has PES University's response been with regards to exams during the COVID-19 pandemic?,"The number of cases are increasing everyday. As of now there are almost 10k inc in the cases everyday and the fact that the students have to travel back from all over the country is way too risky for us. There are so many students who have to travel back from Maharashtra, Tamilnadu, Delhi and many more places which accounts for the max no of cases. Offline exams are not convenient as of now and as far as online exams are considered, there are many students who don't have proper internet connection Or had difficulty in completely understanding the online classes or their doubts have not been cleared. The least we want is the info whether the exam will be conducted or not as soon as possible."
What has PES University's response been with regards to exams during the COVID-19 pandemic?,"Requesting management to confirm if the students will have exams are not as IITs and MIT are promoting students without the exam.We hope we get clear instructions from PESU Management as soon as possible so that it helps us in making decisions and to be mentally prepared. We are trying to contact the management through emails. They are yet to give any official conclusive confirmation. We sincerely hope that they cancel the exams. We hope that they promote students by using their previous marks, lab vivas, ISA marks, and previous semester marks. We also hope that they provide very regular updates so that the students can be mentally prepared and they do not panic during this already uncertain situation."
What has PES University's response been with regards to exams during the COVID-19 pandemic?,"I feel PESU should cancel the ESA and keep the current performance as the final score not only because of the safety of the students who are day scholars but their families too.This has happened in a country where a college in an area with minimum cases started taking exams, and a batch of 280 students was affected the next day even with social distancing measures in place.PESU should also look at the current rising graph of cases in Maharashtra and north Bangalore, where a number of students reside."
What has PES University's response been with regards to exams during the COVID-19 pandemic?,"Already CoVID cases have been continuously increasing and experts say it will peak in July…secondly, hostellites students from PES are from all over the country the transportation is ridiculously expensive and highly unsafe right now…Regarding the online classes, it has not been very effective for some subjects.

What has PES University's response been with regards to exams during the COVID-19 pandemic?,The university has been very irresponsible with the way they provide information they say exams will be held once and then cancel that. It would be very helpful if they just take one firm decision considering all the pros and cons.Since its very hard to understand the syllabus since online class were a waste of time promoting students would be the best option.If exams are a necessity then offline classes must be conducted for atleast 4 weeks prior to the exams

When do the students of 6th Semester of PESIT south campus get chance to attend campus placement interviews? Are they allowed to write along with PESU students? Do they also get a chance for internship from the college along with PESU students?,"south campus guys come in college bus and are allowed to write almost 85% of the companies visiting. yes even for internships. make sure u fill the google form asap sent out by placement cell and register your email, dont mess with ur emails else u will have to rome around to recity that"
Why is PES University placement cell not picking mails or calls of students who lost jobs due to covid-19? 25 plus companies have said they are withdrawing offers or not giving full time. other reputed institutions are helping students not like PES,"All colleges are doing their best to convince companies to honor the placement offers. But companies also have to look at their balance sheet! As USA and European companies are hit by the pandemic, they are looking at cost cutting. This has forced companies to withdraw or stop hiring. But some MNC have indicated that they will honor but 2â€“3 months late.As for placement cell not answering your queries, hope they are not hit by the virus!"
What is PES University doing for students who lost jobs due to covid-19? Nearly 100 students have lost jobs and college is not responding to any mails or calls. Shame on the management and placement office.,"What can the college do? They will have convinced the companies to honor the placements. They will have met them and spoke about the problems, requested etc. Ultimately it's the company decision. Like you, many have lost placements offers in other colleges. Don't expect the college to reply to all messages. It's difficult times for all."

I am planning to do my M.Tech in ECE from PES University. Can I get placed in a good core company if I work hard?,"Getting placement in core branches is hard. Same goes for ECE. I don’t have much idea about the M.Tech program placements in PESU so can’t comment on it.As far as B.Tech ECE is concerned, less than 15% of the batch gets placed in core sectors. Most of them take job in IT or Consultancy.PESU case is not unique, you will find this problem in IIT’s as well. Core sector jobs are less. But if you are willing to work hard, you will surely bag that job, sooner or later. So focus more on the practical skills and all the best!!!"

What has PES University's response been with regards to exams during the COVID-19 pandemic?,"I believe the college is waiting for the government's response to conduct exams or not. Recently, a survey was conducted where many students filled out answers to the questions as to where they stay and is it viable for them to come from their native states to Bangalore to write exams. The college had responded to it appropriately.Personally, I want the college to conduct exams and not promote us based on previous internal marks or previous year marks. It would be unfair to the people who couldnt perform well last time for some reasons. They lose a chance to increase their cgpa which decides their life/ career.I think the college should conduct exams for the 6th semester students and for final year students. The rest can be promoted. As it is important for the immediate placement season.But how they conduct the exams will be a problem. How they do it and when they do it.I am in Bangalore itself and living near PES university. There has been no cases here and since the lockdown was lifted 80% of the people dont wear masks and dont follow social distancing. So i think it will be very dangerous for people here and the students coming from interstate travel to contact the virus.Many students who have answered this question have written that online classes havent been effective. I dont believe that. Atleast for my semester, the online classes were conducted admirably and the doubts were cleared really well. The teachers kept asking for feedback and kept explaining a topic if the student asked for it again. It was better than offline classes for some subjects. And for revision also many teachers discussed and explained previous year question papers. Overall a good experience.Even if students couldnt watch it online at that time due to data issues, 2 months are more than enough to catch up on that. The recorded videos are still in impartus.Bottom line is, I want to write the exams but how and when it happens will be a concern. Just hope that no corona cases come up."
What has PES University's response been with regards to exams during the COVID-19 pandemic?,"All pes has done is give an answer they pulled out of their ass that doesn't ease anyone's stress or clear anyone's doubts about exams. They gave a response for the sake of giving one.And to me, the online classes didn't work out and I stopped watching half way but I know people whom it worked out for. But I think the majority will agree it didn't work out for them or they haven't been able to access it because of data problems. So I find it stupid that pes is even considering keeping exams and adding stress to students during a global pandemic but I think they'll keep exams regardless.It's obvious that they won't be keeping offline exams and will probably keep online exams but if the management isn’t brain-dead they'll realise it's better to just promote all students except final years."
What has PES University's response been with regards to exams during the COVID-19 pandemic?,"First of all CoVID cases have been continuously increasing and experts say it will peak in July…secondly hostelites students from PES are from all over the country the transportation is ridiculously expensive and highly unsafe right now.And with so many people in the hostel it’s highly unsafe and also too many at the hostel mess too.I heard the exams will be conducted in slots from 7–7 , but what about the students who use public transport? Metro is shut and BMTC is not fully functional and it’s not even safe after all.Regarding the online classes it has not been very effective for some subjects.But until now there’s no proper response from college , as PES is a university it doesn’t have any necessity to depend on VTU’s order nor the government order as MIT cancelled exams too.I would just like to question what if even one student gets the virus attending college?

What has PES University's response been with regards to exams during the COVID-19 pandemic?,"PESU's response with regarding the conduction of exams has been unclear and confusing.

As of today, the college has not given any confirmation with regard to the end-semester examination.Though the students have been told that there will be a 2-week notice before the examination begins.But this response is not satisfactory as the students are still confused whether the exam will be held or not.

What has PES University's response been with regards to exams during the COVID-19 pandemic?,"Most of the stuff has been covered in previous answers.The college being autonomous,did a good thing by not conducting the second internals and instead focusing on assignments. However,with claims of the college being at par with the IIT’s , they could follow what the premium institutes like IIT’s ,MIT did, and not hold final exams,for the 2nd 4th and 6th sem .It can do so more easily than other colleges in Karnataka as it is autonomous. PES is a reputed college,attracting students from all over India, so when travelling is such a big issue, it does not make sense to call students to give exams.The least the could do is confirming what they r planning at the earliest,so that the students simply don’t waste their precious time.Hope that a decision is taken soon."

What has PES University's response been with regards to exams during the COVID-19 pandemic?,"The management till now has not given a correct decision on the ESA's, about 3 days the management sent a notice that they are going to conduct examinations, that too saying they will issue the time table shortly and no other information we're given in detail.As the notice focused more on the final year students of the university, they dint mention any decisions being taken on the intermediate semesters and also told 2 weeks prior to the examinations they'll let us know, this 2-week idea is ridiculous as students have to travel and must be under quarantine, and seeing the current situation, I request the management to take appropriate decisions, keeping students interests in mindAnd finally in case if they are sure about conducting exams, offline classes must be conducted 2-3 weeks prior to the exams."
What has PES University's response been with regards to exams during the COVID-19 pandemic?,"There has been no proper information given by PESU regarding the examination. It is really confusing for the students whether to study for the examination or not.The online classes which were held helped,but not to great extent because most of the students did not have the proper resources, and most of the student weren't able to follow the topics .A major concern for the students is traveling if the examination has been conducted by the College as most of the students travel in public transportation.Taking public transport in this situation is very risky and unsafe.I request the management of PESU to look into the matter,and inform the students as soon as possible whether the examination is going to be held or canceled."
What has PES University's response been with regards to exams during the COVID-19 pandemic?,PES should also take an honest opinion from the parents on the conduction of exams. As most of the parents are more concerned about the exponentially increasing rate of COVID-19 cases and not want their children to get exposed to this environment.They should also note the fact that many students take public transport as a result high chance of them getting infected. Therefore all the conditions are unfavorable for the institution to hold the exam.I personally think it wouldn't be smart for PESU to put on hold- the exams currently because of the obvious health risk and the fact that many students cannot come from different states
What has PES University's response been with regards to exams during the COVID-19 pandemic?,"Due to the coronavirus pandemic lot of things are uncertain. Recently a VTU student got infected with covid-19 while Travelling from Chennai to bangalore. Like this way, this may be the fate of many students across the globe. Also conduction of offline classes is highly impossible now.The HRD minister Dr. RP Nishank has directed the state govt to take a decision on promotion of university students except the final years. As it is a clear green signal from the central Government, I request the PES University to come up with a fair decision very soon and I hope it will be as per UGC which is promotion"
What has PES University's response been with regards to exams during the COVID-19 pandemic?,The University has neither been quick nor clear in giving a response with regard to exams.The students have been told that they will be informed 2 weeks prior to the conduction of the exams but this still hasn't provided any clarity on whether the exams are going to be conducted or not.Students are currently stranded in all parts of the country and it is very stressful to them as they are studying endlessly .Added to this is the risk of traveling not just to the exam center but also across the country in order to get back to Bangalore.The situation is just getting worse everyday but it seems as though the university is neglecting that part to a great extent .Hopefully the students will be informed not just 2 weeks prior but as soon as possible about the conduction of the exams with surety as this confusion is not helpful in these already difficult times.
What has PES University's response been with regards to exams during the COVID-19 pandemic?,"The University hasn't given any clarity on this!Looks like it will not cancel exams,When Universities like VIT , MIT and also IIT'S AND NIT'S have promoted intermediate semester students it's dissapointing to see PES to go ahead with conducting exams without being considerate towards students problems and future!Wish students at PES and also other private colleges in Karnataka meet a logical end and get promoted as being done by many premier institutes of India keeping in mind whatever we have done in previous semester and internal assessment of this semester!I'm going anonymous for obvious reasons!Thank you!"
What has PES University's response been with regards to exams during the COVID-19 pandemic?,"The number of cases are increasing everyday. As of now there are almost 10k inc in the cases everyday and the fact that the students have to travel back from all over the country is way too risky for us. There are so many students who have to travel back from Maharashtra, Tamilnadu, Delhi and many more places which accounts for the max no of cases. Offline exams are not convenient as of now and as far as online exams are considered, there are many students who don't have proper internet connection Or had difficulty in completely understanding the online classes or their doubts have not been cleared. The least we want is the info whether the exam will be conducted or not as soon as possible."
What has PES University's response been with regards to exams during the COVID-19 pandemic?,"Requesting management to confirm if the students will have exams are not as IITs and MIT are promoting students without the exam.We hope we get clear instructions from PESU Management as soon as possible so that it helps us in making decisions and to be mentally prepared. We are trying to contact the management through emails. They are yet to give any official conclusive confirmation. We sincerely hope that they cancel the exams. We hope that they promote students by using their previous marks, lab vivas, ISA marks, and previous semester marks. We also hope that they provide very regular updates so that the students can be mentally prepared and they do not panic during this already uncertain situation."
What has PES University's response been with regards to exams during the COVID-19 pandemic?,"I feel PESU should cancel the ESA and keep the current performance as the final score not only because of the safety of the students who are day scholars but their families too.This has happened in a country where a college in an area with minimum cases started taking exams, and a batch of 280 students was affected the next day even with social distancing measures in place.PESU should also look at the current rising graph of cases in Maharashtra and north Bangalore, where a number of students reside."
What has PES University's response been with regards to exams during the COVID-19 pandemic?,"Already CoVID cases have been continuously increasing and experts say it will peak in July…secondly, hostellites students from PES are from all over the country the transportation is ridiculously expensive and highly unsafe right now…Regarding the online classes, it has not been very effective for some subjects. But until now there’s no proper response from college, as PES is a university it doesn’t have any necessity to depend on VTU’s order nor the government order as MIT canceled exams too.I would just like to question what if even one student gets the virus attending college? (Maybe in the hostel, transport, mess, PG, examination hall) will college take responsibility for it? Please value our lives and promote us."

What has PES University's response been with regards to exams during the COVID-19 pandemic?,The university has been very irresponsible with the way they provide information they say exams will be held once and then cancel that. It would be very helpful if they just take one firm decision considering all the pros and cons.Since its very hard to understand the syllabus since online class were a waste of time promoting students would be the best option.If exams are a necessity then offline classes must be conducted for atleast 4 weeks prior to the exams

When do the students of 6th Semester of PESIT south campus get chance to attend campus placement interviews? Are they allowed to write along with PESU students? Do they also get a chance for internship from the college along with PESU students?,"south campus guys come in college bus and are allowed to write almost 85% of the companies visiting. yes even for internships. make sure u fill the google form asap sent out by placement cell and register your email, dont mess with ur emails else u will have to rome around to recity that"
Why is PES University placement cell not picking mails or calls of students who lost jobs due to covid-19? 25 plus companies have said they are withdrawing offers or not giving full time. other reputed institutions are helping students not like PES,"All colleges are doing their best to convince companies to honor the placement offers. But companies also have to look at their balance sheet! As USA and European companies are hit by the pandemic, they are looking at cost cutting. This has forced companies to withdraw or stop hiring. But some MNC have indicated that they will honor but 2â€“3 months late.As for placement cell not answering your queries, hope they are not hit by the virus!"
What is PES University doing for students who lost jobs due to covid-19? Nearly 100 students have lost jobs and college is not responding to any mails or calls. Shame on the management and placement office.,"What can the college do? They will have convinced the companies to honor the placements. They will have met them and spoke about the problems, requested etc. Ultimately it's the company decision. Like you, many have lost placements offers in other colleges. Don't expect the college to reply to all messages. It's difficult times for all."
Is the PESSAT exam applicable for diploma students?,No. The PESSAT exam is only for PU( class -12th) passed people. For Diploma folks there is a lateral entry in 2nd year via the state conducted exam.
Is the PESSAT exam applicable for diploma students?,No the PESSAT exam is only applicable to Class 12 students. For diploma students there is a separate exam which is conducted by the Karnataka Education Authority.
I am planning to do my M.Tech in ECE from PES University. Can I get placed in a good core company if I work hard?,"Getting placement in core branches is hard. Same goes for ECE. I don’t have much idea about the M.Tech program placements in PESU so can’t comment on it.As far as B.Tech ECE is concerned, less than 15% of the batch gets placed in core sectors. Most of them take job in IT or Consultancy.PESU case is not unique, you will find this problem in IIT’s as well. Core sector jobs are less. But if you are willing to work hard, you will surely bag that job, sooner or later. So focus more on the practical skills and all the best!!!"
Are vehicles allowed in PES university hostel? (north campus),"Yes, Vehicles are allowed in the college hostel"
Why has PESU scored such a low ranking in the NIRF 2020? Most of the other Bangalore colleges have obtained a higher ranking.,"The reason their ranking has dropped is that they have started using their proprietary exam system, the PESAT. The PESAT is a premier exam in the state of Karnataka, however, the discrepancies between the rankings students acquire in PESAT and government exams such as the COMEDK are huge. Since the NIRF does not have a base metric to judge the admittance in PESU due to the PESAT, their ranking has plummeted."
Why is the highest package offered at NIT Surathkal lower than RVCE and PES University in B.Tech CSE placements?,"I don’t know about the highest package in RVCE or NIT Suratkal but I can definitely tell you that packages are nothing to do with how good a college is.We hear a lot of news of people bagging some crores package in IIT’s or some other reputed college. This make us think that package relates to the quality of the college you study. Although you cannot directly decline this hypothesis but this doesn’t works all the time.Don’t focus over placements , no matter how bad a college is there will be always a bright student there who will work his ass off and bag that lucrative package you always dreamed. So just choose one and work hard to learn."
Why is the highest package offered at NIT Surathkal lower than RVCE and PES University in B.Tech CSE placements?,"Nope, this is not true. You can say that the highest packages mentioned in the placement brochure of NIT Surathkal may be lower than the highest packages of the colleges you mentioned. In placement brochure, only those packages and offers are mentioned which are offered by companies visiting the campus. The best coders of NITK do not even attend the placement process. They already have hefty job offers even before placement season begins, so they really don't have to attend the placement process of NITK. In my batch, two of the top coders got placed in Google Zurich office after internship program which they got after GSOC. There are many more such example.P.S. : Highest domestic package of NITK during 2017–2018 placement season was 38 LPA by Uber. So, I think you need to verify your facts again."
Why is the highest package offered at NIT Surathkal lower than RVCE and PES University in B.Tech CSE placements?,"Because the placement stats published by any Indian engineering college is NOT accurate and honest.NIT-Trichy, Surathkal, Warangal = Tier-1RV and PES are fraud tier-4 Indian engineering colleges."
"Does PESU RR campus offer minors in management-related courses? If so, what details are available in this regard?","Yes, PESU RR does provide minors in management related courses like finance etc. I have a very limited knowledge since some of my classmates are enrolled in it. They both have taken a course in finance. While the semester is ongoing we can take only one minor subject instead of 2 in summers.The timings are very relaxed. Its thrice/twice a week for 2hrs a day. Internal assessments and esa is also there. Its taken after college ends. According to them, it has not been a very burdensome subject to take on.Minor courses are offered from 1st year onwards, notices are put up everywhere on how to register for a minor course, how forms should be filled and the fees paid."
"Which is better for CSE, Nirma University or PES University?","Bruh! Can you hear yourself?If someone asks you in the future where did you graduate from, you gonna reply ‘I graduated from Nirma University’?What is the college's motto? -Doodh ki safedi Nirma se aayi, rangeen bache bhi khil khil jaye, Nirma se baandha samaa???Ghar bhar ke bacho ko pal mein nikkhaareHema, Rekha, Jaya aur Sushma! Sabki pasand Nirma!Lolol I am kidding.This is not even a comparison, PES ranks amongst the top colleges in Karnataka for CSE and Nirma university is unheard of. The only minus point of PES is the high fees. Except that, PES all the way.The kind of exposure a cse student gets in PESU is crazy. Competitive coding, hackathons, projects, research papers and to work in great many clubs is a great oppurtunity for the students to indulge in. The syllabus is also tailored to meet the latest industrial requirements. Every year the syllabus is updated. So its a very simple decison to choose PESU over Nirma."
"Is the entire annual fee of PES University taken all at once every year, or is it taken semester by semester?",The entire annual fee is taken all at once during the start of every new academic year. The time to pay is generally from June 15th to August 20th (may need to confirm). After that late fee charges gets added.
Is it possible to shift branches from EEE to ECE after the first year at PESU?,"Hey there!It is quite possible to shift but it largely depends on the number of seats left , number of people and your CGPA. You need to be among the top 5% of your batch to achieve this. You need to remember that there will be diploma students as well in this raceDuring the beginning of my second year, we had a few transfers from mechanical, and ig 1â€“2 from EEE.Anything you imagine is possibleSo stay safe, study hard and don't be disappointed if you don't get it ! The world is your oyester, seize it :)"
Is it possible to shift branches from EEE to ECE after the first year at PESU?,Yes it depends on lot other factors as well1)You need to get a really nice CGPA for that and should among the top students in your branch2)It depends whether there are vacant seats available for the change of branch3) You should not miss any test at any costAlso if you are eligible for it you need to pay an additional 10k for the same
What has PES University's response been with regards to exams during the COVID-19 pandemic?,"The response from the administration has not been very clear. In their most recent announcement, they promised they would announce the exam schedule 2 weeks before they are to take place. However, no clarity was offered on the mode of examination.If the exams are going to be held offline, it would jeopardise the safety of students, particularly those using public transport. Since COVID-19 is asymptomatic, thermal checks can not guarantee that a person is not infected.Additionally, COVID-19 cases in India are expected to peak in July or August (Links here :India's coronavirus cases peak yet to come: AIIMS DirectorTop WHO expert's warning: India faces risk of coronavirus explosionCovid-19 peak likely in July-August: Dr SK Sarin )Conducting offline exams in July or August would seem to be out of the question. Online classes conducted by the college were good, but doubt clearing was an issue, as is the case with any online learning platform. Due to bandwidth issues all across India, Internet speeds weren't good for many students, leading to disturbances in the video/audio quality. The same Internet issues could crop up while giving the exams, if conducted online.Deputy CM of Karnataka Dr. Ashwat Narayan recently spoke about offline classes being held before the exams to help the students.

What has PES University's response been with regards to exams during the COVID-19 pandemic?,"The management till now has not given a correct decision on the ESA's, about 3 days the management sent a notice that they are going to conduct examinations, that too saying they will issue the time table shortly and no other information we're given in detail.As the notice focused more on the final year students of the university, they dint mention any decisions being taken on the intermediate semesters and also told 2 weeks prior to the examinations they'll let us know, this 2-week idea is ridiculous as students have to travel and must be under quarantine, and seeing the current situation, I request the management to take appropriate decisions, keeping students interests in mindAnd finally in case if they are sure about conducting exams, offline classes must be conducted 2-3 weeks prior to the exams."
What has PES University's response been with regards to exams during the COVID-19 pandemic?,"There has been no proper information given by PESU regarding the examination.

(Maybe in the hostel, transport, mess, PG, examination hall) will college take responsibility for it? Please value our lives and promote us."
What has PES University's response been with regards to exams during the COVID-19 pandemic?,"From the news which I got from professors and students, it seems like PESU will be conducting exams irrespective of the current situation. PESU just wants to decide if it is online or offline.Now if it wants to conduct exams offline, people from almost all over the country should be traveling, which is not a safe option as students might get in contact with the virus and by doing this they will be spreading the virus even more.And the online option is not very feasible, due to the lack of stable internet connectivity for some students. And a lot of students couldn’t attend the online classes due to the same reason.So a viable option is to cancel the exams and promote us based on the ISA’s, assignments, and projects. And it would be better for the students if PESU responded as soon as possible."

What has PES University's response been with regards to exams during the COVID-19 pandemic?,The university has been very irresponsible with the way they provide information they say exams will be held once and then cancel that. It would be very helpful if they just take one firm decision considering all the pros and cons.Since its very hard to understand the syllabus since online class were a waste of time promoting students would be the best option.If exams are a necessity then offline classes must be conducted for atleast 4 weeks prior to the exams

When do the students of 6th Semester of PESIT south campus get chance to attend campus placement interviews? Are they allowed to write along with PESU students? Do they also get a chance for internship from the college along with PESU students?,"south campus guys come in college bus and are allowed to write almost 85% of the companies visiting. yes even for internships. make sure u fill the google form asap sent out by placement cell and register your email, dont mess with ur emails else u will have to rome around to recity that"
Why is PES University placement cell not picking mails or calls of students who lost jobs due to covid-19? 25 plus companies have said they are withdrawing offers or not giving full time. other reputed institutions are helping students not like PES,"All colleges are doing their best to convince companies to honor the placement offers. But companies also have to look at their balance sheet! As USA and European companies are hit by the pandemic, they are looking at cost cutting. This has forced companies to withdraw or stop hiring. But some MNC have indicated that they will honor but 2â€“3 months late.As for placement cell not answering your queries, hope they are not hit by the virus!"
What is PES University doing for students who lost jobs due to covid-19? Nearly 100 students have lost jobs and college is not responding to any mails or calls. Shame on the management and placement office.,"What can the college do? They will have convinced the companies to honor the placements. They will have met them and spoke about the problems, requested etc. Ultimately it's the company decision. Like you, many have lost placements offers in other colleges. Don't expect the college to reply to all messages. It's difficult times for all."
Is the PESSAT exam applicable for diploma students?,No. The PESSAT exam is only for PU( class -12th) passed people. For Diploma folks there is a lateral entry in 2nd year via the state conducted exam.
Is the PESSAT exam applicable for diploma students?,No the PESSAT exam is only applicable to Class 12 students. For diploma students there is a separate exam which is conducted by the Karnataka Education Authority.
I am planning to do my M.Tech in ECE from PES University. Can I get placed in a good core company if I work hard?,"Getting placement in core branches is hard. Same goes for ECE. I don’t have much idea about the M.Tech program placements in PESU so can’t comment on it.As far as B.Tech ECE is concerned, less than 15% of the batch gets placed in core sectors. Most of them take job in IT or Consultancy.PESU case is not unique, you will find this problem in IIT’s as well. Core sector jobs are less. But if you are willing to work hard, you will surely bag that job, sooner or later. So focus more on the practical skills and all the best!!!"

Why has PESU scored such a low ranking in the NIRF 2020? Most of the other Bangalore colleges have obtained a higher ranking.,"The reason their ranking has dropped is that they have started using their proprietary exam system, the PESAT. The PESAT is a premier exam in the state of Karnataka, however, the discrepancies between the rankings students acquire in PESAT and government exams such as the COMEDK are huge. Since the NIRF does not have a base metric to judge the admittance in PESU due to the PESAT, their ranking has plummeted."
Why is the highest package offered at NIT Surathkal lower than RVCE and PES University in B.Tech CSE placements?,"I don’t know about the highest package in RVCE or NIT Suratkal but I can definitely tell you that packages are nothing to do with how good a college is.We hear a lot of news of people bagging some crores package in IIT’s or some other reputed college. This make us think that package relates to the quality of the college you study. Although you cannot directly decline this hypothesis but this doesn’t works all the time.Don’t focus over placements , no matter how bad a college is there will be always a bright student there who will work his ass off and bag that lucrative package you always dreamed. So just choose one and work hard to learn."
Why is the highest package offered at NIT Surathkal lower than RVCE and PES University in B.Tech CSE placements?,"Nope, this is not true. You can say that the highest packages mentioned in the placement brochure of NIT Surathkal may be lower than the highest packages of the colleges you mentioned. In placement brochure, only those packages and offers are mentioned which are offered by companies visiting the campus. The best coders of NITK do not even attend the placement process. They already have hefty job offers even before placement season begins, so they really don't have to attend the placement process of NITK. In my batch, two of the top coders got placed in Google Zurich office after internship program which they got after GSOC. There are many more such example.P.S. : Highest domestic package of NITK during 2017–2018 placement season was 38 LPA by Uber. So, I think you need to verify your facts again."
Why is the highest package offered at NIT Surathkal lower than RVCE and PES University in B.Tech CSE placements?,"Because the placement stats published by any Indian engineering college is NOT accurate and honest.NIT-Trichy, Surathkal, Warangal = Tier-1RV and PES are fraud tier-4 Indian engineering colleges."
"Does PESU RR campus offer minors in management-related courses? If so, what details are available in this regard?","Yes, PESU RR does provide minors in management related courses like finance etc. I have a very limited knowledge since some of my classmates are enrolled in it. They both have taken a course in finance. While the semester is ongoing we can take only one minor subject instead of 2 in summers.The timings are very relaxed. Its thrice/twice a week for 2hrs a day. Internal assessments and esa is also there. Its taken after college ends. According to them, it has not been a very burdensome subject to take on.Minor courses are offered from 1st year onwards, notices are put up everywhere on how to register for a minor course, how forms should be filled and the fees paid."
"Which is better for CSE, Nirma University or PES University?","Bruh! Can you hear yourself?If someone asks you in the future where did you graduate from, you gonna reply ‘I graduated from Nirma University’?What is the college's motto? -Doodh ki safedi Nirma se aayi, rangeen bache bhi khil khil jaye, Nirma se baandha samaa???Ghar bhar ke bacho ko pal mein nikkhaareHema, Rekha, Jaya aur Sushma! Sabki pasand Nirma!Lolol I am kidding.This is not even a comparison, PES ranks amongst the top colleges in Karnataka for CSE and Nirma university is unheard of. The only minus point of PES is the high fees. Except that, PES all the way.The kind of exposure a cse student gets in PESU is crazy. Competitive coding, hackathons, projects, research papers and to work in great many clubs is a great oppurtunity for the students to indulge in. The syllabus is also tailored to meet the latest industrial requirements. Every year the syllabus is updated. So its a very simple decison to choose PESU over Nirma."
"Is the entire annual fee of PES University taken all at once every year, or is it taken semester by semester?",The entire annual fee is taken all at once during the start of every new academic year. The time to pay is generally from June 15th to August 20th (may need to confirm). After that late fee charges gets added.
Is it possible to shift branches from EEE to ECE after the first year at PESU?,"Hey there!It is quite possible to shift but it largely depends on the number of seats left , number of people and your CGPA. You need to be among the top 5% of your batch to achieve this. You need to remember that there will be diploma students as well in this raceDuring the beginning of my second year, we had a few transfers from mechanical, and ig 1â€“2 from EEE.Anything you imagine is possibleSo stay safe, study hard and don't be disappointed if you don't get it ! The world is your oyester, seize it :)"
Is it possible to shift branches from EEE to ECE after the first year at PESU?,Yes it depends on lot other factors as well1)You need to get a really nice CGPA for that and should among the top students in your branch2)It depends whether there are vacant seats available for the change of branch3) You should not miss any test at any costAlso if you are eligible for it you need to pay an additional 10k for the same
What has PES University's response been with regards to exams during the COVID-19 pandemic?,"The response from the administration has not been very clear. In their most recent announcement, they promised they would announce the exam schedule 2 weeks before they are to take place. However, no clarity was offered on the mode of examination.If the exams are going to be held offline, it would jeopardise the safety of students, particularly those using public transport. Since COVID-19 is asymptomatic, thermal checks can not guarantee that a person is not infected.Additionally, COVID-19 cases in India are expected to peak in July or August (Links here :India's coronavirus cases peak yet to come: AIIMS DirectorTop WHO expert's warning: India faces risk of coronavirus explosionCovid-19 peak likely in July-August: Dr SK Sarin )Conducting offline exams in July or August would seem to be out of the question. Online classes conducted by the college were good, but doubt clearing was an issue, as is the case with any online learning platform. Due to bandwidth issues all across India, Internet speeds weren't good for many students, leading to disturbances in the video/audio quality. The same Internet issues could crop up while giving the exams, if conducted online.Deputy CM of Karnataka Dr. Ashwat Narayan recently spoke about offline classes being held before the exams to help the students. This would be more ideal than keeping the exams directly although this comes with its own set of issues with regards to the academic calendar.Some colleges like NIT Warangal and Manipal Institute of Technology have followed the UGC guidelines of evaluating the result using the performance in internals and assignments.Hopefully the college administration comes up with a more clear and concise plan as soon as possible to reduce the pressure on students during this worldwide epidemic."
What has PES University's response been with regards to exams during the COVID-19 pandemic?,"I believe the college is waiting for the government's response to conduct exams or not. Recently, a survey was conducted where many students filled out answers to the questions as to where they stay and is it viable for them to come from their native states to Bangalore to write exams. The college had responded to it appropriately.Personally, I want the college to conduct exams and not promote us based on previous internal marks or previous year marks. It would be unfair to the people who couldnt perform well last time for some reasons. They lose a chance to increase their cgpa which decides their life/ career.I think the college should conduct exams for the 6th semester students and for final year students. The rest can be promoted. As it is important for the immediate placement season.But how they conduct the exams will be a problem. How they do it and when they do it.I am in Bangalore itself and living near PES university. There has been no cases here and since the lockdown was lifted 80% of the people dont wear masks and dont follow social distancing. So i think it will be very dangerous for people here and the students coming from interstate travel to contact the virus.Many students who have answered this question have written that online classes havent been effective. I dont believe that. Atleast for my semester, the online classes were conducted admirably and the doubts were cleared really well. The teachers kept asking for feedback and kept explaining a topic if the student asked for it again. It was better than offline classes for some subjects. And for revision also many teachers discussed and explained previous year question papers. Overall a good experience.Even if students couldnt watch it online at that time due to data issues, 2 months are more than enough to catch up on that. The recorded videos are still in impartus.Bottom line is, I want to write the exams but how and when it happens will be a concern. Just hope that no corona cases come up."
What has PES University's response been with regards to exams during the COVID-19 pandemic?,"All pes has done is give an answer they pulled out of their ass that doesn't ease anyone's stress or clear anyone's doubts about exams. They gave a response for the sake of giving one.And to me, the online classes didn't work out and I stopped watching half way but I know people whom it worked out for. But I think the majority will agree it didn't work out for them or they haven't been able to access it because of data problems. So I find it stupid that pes is even considering keeping exams and adding stress to students during a global pandemic but I think they'll keep exams regardless.It's obvious that they won't be keeping offline exams and will probably keep online exams but if the management isn’t brain-dead they'll realise it's better to just promote all students except final years."
What has PES University's response been with regards to exams during the COVID-19 pandemic?,"First of all CoVID cases have been continuously increasing and experts say it will peak in July…secondly hostelites students from PES are from all over the country the transportation is ridiculously expensive and highly unsafe right now.And with so many people in the hostel it’s highly unsafe and also too many at the hostel mess too.I heard the exams will be conducted in slots from 7–7 , but what about the students who use public transport? Metro is shut and BMTC is not fully functional and it’s not even safe after all.Regarding the online classes it has not been very effective for some subjects.But until now there’s no proper response from college , as PES is a university it doesn’t have any necessity to depend on VTU’s order nor the government order as MIT cancelled exams too.I would just like to question what if even one student gets the virus attending college?

What has PES University's response been with regards to exams during the COVID-19 pandemic?,"PESU's response with regarding the conduction of exams has been unclear and confusing. One of the internals was cancelled as the college was in lockdown.Instead of the second internal the college had given more assignments for evaluation. As of today, the college has not given any confirmation with regard to the end-semester examination.Though the students have been told that there will be a 2-week notice before the examination begins.But this response is not satisfactory as the students are still confused whether the exam will be held or not. There have been several requests by the students for the cancellation of the exam. For this as well there has been no clear response.The college seems to be deciding on how to conduct the exam instead of whether to conduct the exam or not."
What has PES University's response been with regards to exams during the COVID-19 pandemic?,"Most of the stuff has been covered in previous answers.The college being autonomous,did a good thing by not conducting the second internals and instead focusing on assignments. However,with claims of the college being at par with the IIT’s , they could follow what the premium institutes like IIT’s ,MIT did, and not hold final exams,for the 2nd 4th and 6th sem .It can do so more easily than other colleges in Karnataka as it is autonomous. PES is a reputed college,attracting students from all over India, so when travelling is such a big issue, it does not make sense to call students to give exams.The least the could do is confirming what they r planning at the earliest,so that the students simply don’t waste their precious time.Hope that a decision is taken soon."

(Maybe in the hostel, transport, mess, PG, examination hall) will college take responsibility for it? Please value our lives and promote us."
What has PES University's response been with regards to exams during the COVID-19 pandemic?,"From the news which I got from professors and students, it seems like PESU will be conducting exams irrespective of the current situation. PESU just wants to decide if it is online or offline.Now if it wants to conduct exams offline, people from almost all over the country should be traveling, which is not a safe option as students might get in contact with the virus and by doing this they will be spreading the virus even more.And the online option is not very feasible, due to the lack of stable internet connectivity for some students. And a lot of students couldn’t attend the online classes due to the same reason.So a viable option is to cancel the exams and promote us based on the ISA’s, assignments, and projects. And it would be better for the students if PESU responded as soon as possible."
What has PES University's response been with regards to exams during the COVID-19 pandemic?,"There has been no proper information given by PESU regarding the examination.The University has neither been quick nor clear in giving a response with regard to exams.When Universities like VIT , MIT and also IIT'S AND NIT'S have promoted intermediate semester students it's dissapointing to see PES to go ahead with conducting exams without being considerate towards students problems and future!I request the management of PESU to look into the matter,and inform the students as soon as possible whether the examination is going to be held or canceled."
What has PES University's response been with regards to exams during the COVID-19 pandemic?,The university has been very irresponsible with the way they provide information they say exams will be held once and then cancel that. It would be very helpful if they just take one firm decision considering all the pros and cons.Since its very hard to understand the syllabus since online class were a waste of time promoting students would be the best option.If exams are a necessity then offline classes must be conducted for atleast 4 weeks prior to the exams
What has PES University's response been with regards to exams during the COVID-19 pandemic?,PES should also take a honest opinion from the parents on conduction of exams. As most of the parents are more concerned about the exponentially increasing rate of covid-19 cases and not want their children to get exposed to this environment. They should also note the fact that many students take public transport as a result high chance of them getting infected. Therefore all the conditions are unfavourable for the institution to hold exam.
What has PES University's response been with regards to exams during the COVID-19 pandemic?,Requesting management to confirm if the students will have exams are not as IITs and MIT are promoting students without exam. We hope we get clear instructions from PESU Management as soon as possible so that it helps us in making decisions and to be mentally prepared.Going anonymous for obvious reasons.
What has PES University's response been with regards to exams during the COVID-19 pandemic?,"We are trying to contact the management through emails. They are yet to give any official conclusive confirmation. We sincerely hope that they cancel the exams. We hope that they promote students by using their previous marks, lab vivas, ISA marks, and previous semester marks. We also hope that they provide very regular updates so that the students can be mentally prepared and they do not panic during this already uncertain situation."
When do the students of 6th Semester of PESIT south campus get chance to attend campus placement interviews? Are they allowed to write along with PESU students? Do they also get a chance for internship from the college along with PESU students?,"south campus guys come in college bus and are allowed to write almost 85% of the companies visiting. yes even for internships. make sure u fill the google form asap sent out by placement cell and register your email, dont mess with ur emails else u will have to rome around to recity that"
Why is PES University placement cell not picking mails or calls of students who lost jobs due to covid-19? 25 plus companies have said they are withdrawing offers or not giving full time. other reputed institutions are helping students not like PES,"All colleges are doing their best to convince companies to honor the placement offers. But companies also have to look at their balance sheet! As USA and European companies are hit by the pandemic, they are looking at cost cutting. This has forced companies to withdraw or stop hiring. But some MNC have indicated that they will honor but 2â€“3 months late.As for placement cell not answering your queries, hope they are not hit by the virus!"
What is PES University doing for students who lost jobs due to covid-19? Nearly 100 students have lost jobs and college is not responding to any mails or calls. Shame on the management and placement office.,"What can the college do? They will have convinced the companies to honor the placements. They will have met them and spoke about the problems, requested etc. Ultimately it's the company decision. Like you, many have lost placements offers in other colleges. Don't expect the college to reply to all messages. It's difficult times for all."

I am planning to do my M.Tech in ECE from PES University. Can I get placed in a good core company if I work hard?,"Getting placement in core branches is hard. Same goes for ECE. I don’t have much idea about the M.Tech program placements in PESU so can’t comment on it.As far as B.Tech ECE is concerned, less than 15% of the batch gets placed in core sectors. Most of them take job in IT or Consultancy.PESU case is not unique, you will find this problem in IIT’s as well. Core sector jobs are less. But if you are willing to work hard, you will surely bag that job, sooner or later. So focus more on the practical skills and all the best!!!"
