Placement at IITM can be divided into 2 categories, namely core (Mechanical and civil) and non-core (banking, IT, consultancies, FMCG and data science). For core category in ocean engineering, situation is not so good. Most of the companies don't allow ocean engineering branch for core profile (not open, in IITM lingo).

Placement at IITM can be divided into 2 categories, namely core (Mechanical and civil) and non-core (banking, IT, consultancies, FMCG and data science). For core category in ocean engineering, situation is not so good. Most of the companies don't allow ocean engineering branch for core profile (not open, in IITM lingo). Mainly, companies in the sector of oil and gas sector opens for ocean engineering, but again situation of oil and gas sector is grim right now and will take 2–3 years to normalised. As for the other sectors, even if companies open for ocean engineering, they have stiff competition from Mechanical, Applied Mechanics and Aerospace department. These programs (machine design, computational and experimental Mechanics, thermal, Aerospace) generally have better overall course structures which suits wide sectors from OnG, automobile, aerospace etc and hence they have advantage over ocean engineering branch which have course structure specialised in ocean structures. So for ocean engineering student it acts as a double whammy i.e. companies not allowing them sit and even if they allow, have disadvantages in comparison to other programs students sitting for placement. I am not saying, it not possible but it is very hard and student have to be very good for core placement. Now for non-core categories, here all are equals. Most of the non-core profiles (95%) are open for whole institute. But to get placed in non-core a student have to follow a certain path, which I have described below. Start learning python, machine learning (have good grasp of linear algebra and probability & statistics), data science, deep learning from the starts of your mtech. Choose your electives from this domain and don't shy from MOOCs.Do course project and capstone project related to above domain and take part in kaggle and other such competitions.Learn basic sql (its easy and can be learn in 2 months).Do internship in your summer vacation.Placement in non-core sector requires hard work but it is guaranteed. In recent placement, all of my friends from ocean who were appearing in non-core profile have got decent placement in MNCs, while others who were appearing in core profile, some are still not placed. Disclaimer: My advice is don't try for both core and non-core, those who ride 2 boat at a time will eventually drown. Decide as soon as possible and focus on it like Arjun was.

IITs were established to provide finest technical manpower for building the nation. IISc was established by private bodies to conduct core research with focus on advancing the scientific capabilities of the country. Therefore these institutes provide Knowledge according to their fundamentals.You see hell lot of IITians in companies running there with a shiny life style and if you get a chance to go to IISc you feel the calm and focus without much shiny life style and a commitment to research and scientific advancements.IITs have several thousand students studying different streams of engineering to equip themselves to set in industry where as IISc have few students working towards high end research and get into research industries in the nation.Faculty Have a look onto any department faculty list in IISc and IITs, you would be amazed to see people who with noble laureates and few were nominated for noble prize too still love their lab and work in IISc. Popularity IISC is as popular as the IITs, in the academic circles. It is just not that much in the spotlight in media as the IITs. The number of IITs is 23, and there is only one IISC. So even if one IIT comes in news every day, the IITs automatically grab more spotlight.

So I’ll answer for both cases. I’ll try to cover up both cases. Government has announced to conduct IIT JEE exam in September 2020. Because of uncertainty due to pandemic, the exam can be postponed further. Assuming exam happens in September only, students will be able to take admission by the end of 2020 mostly, as results and counseling will take around two months. First year students are accommodated in double shared rooms (Cauvery Hostel :)). But due to ongoing pandemic, this would not be possible. IIT Madras doesn’t have enough hostels to accommodate everyone single in rooms. Few weeks ago we received a mail stating some changes which will be made because of pandemic. I’m summarizing them in points. Whenever the students will be called, they will not be called all at once. Those doing research (Phd students) and projects (usually, MTech and Dual Degree students) will be called first. ,Thus second year and third year students will most probably continue their online classes (Yeah, even in 2021 even semester). First year will be given priority like phd and mtech students in calling to institute.Since the norms of social distancing has to be followed, the classes will be split in parts. Currently, for my batch, there are two classes- odd roll numbered and even roll numbered.My class was having two lab courses in odd semester 2020, but now they will get cancelled and will be conducted in one go (say, within 10 days) whenever we reach institute. Same trend will be followed in 2021.All the fun is gone: We had uncountable co curricular activities for people of diverse interest. Nothing will happen now. Even OAT (Open air theater) movies may not be displayed!!No Technical and Cultural Fest: No Shaashtra, No Saarang!! Find out on internet what they are! (Anyways I told it in heading… hahaha)IIT Madras students are very enthusiastic. Once students reach institute, students will try for projects creating solution to fight corona virus.

Of course, some reputed universities like BITS Pilani, IIIT Bangalore etc are offering Post Graduate Diploma, MS or M.Tech programs through their own platforms or via making collaboration with UpGrad etc. But none of them are like their flagship programs. But this covid pandemic is changing the education system everywhere and especially in India where some of the eminent institutes like some IITs are going to conduct their academic session completely online this year. But the most important is recently IIT Madras declared they are starting world’s first online B. Sc Degree program in Programming and Data Science and they don’t need to appear for JEE. Though at present some details of a program are still unknown like its credibility or acceptance for higher education like pursuing masters in the abroad or India. This is what I find out after I googled about it: A program with two entry and three exit points, it has the capacity to enroll over 2,50,000 students, with no geographical or age restrictions. (Though I am skeptical about this number and wonder the usefulness of producing this many data science graduates in current market.) The applicants are only mandated to have passed class XII in a stream that includes English and Mathematics. Even college dropout student can also pursue this one. So in my opinion, this online B.

Its a jail on campus! dont take my world for it , this was published on Hindustan times How come almost all the engineering branches taught in all the developed countries have internships or research internship opportunities, but in India even the computer engineering internship culture is not developed ? Why is it so ? There is a heavy industry-academia integration in all the developed countries. The professors in the engineering colleges of the developed countries(like Germany, USA etc) are paid by the industry to carryout research for the industry with the help of the present students of the engineering college. So, the formality of taking the engineering semester exams are fulfilled by all the engineering students, but 90% if the brain-time by the engineering professors and engineering students in the developed countries is devoted to the engineering research. So, if these engineering students are not able to become a good researcher, all such engineering students become engineers in the industry, because majority of such engineering students have proper research experience which can only be done if the engineering concepts are clearer. The engineering colleges in all the developed countries is funded by the government and the industry and they can buy any instrument to gain the recent skills in demand by making use of that instrument.Now zoom the image below carefully. The image is about he NASA engineers celebrating about the successful landing of the Curiosity rover on Mars planet. Read carefully the the engraving on the wall of the room. It reads “Jet Propulsion Laboratory California Institute of Technology”. This means that this is the lab of CalTech. The similar integration is there in all the engineering institutions of all the developed countries of the world.  (CREDITS PRAVEEN KUMAR SHING) So How to make the tier 3/4 colleges great in india? You cannot do anything because Indian engineering curriculum is 40 years old. To update the Indian engineering curriculum with updated equipment and imported professors Indian govt shall have to spend about 2 lakh crores of Indian rupees, per college in India.

Like the director himself has said “We must bring a closure to the current semester to help our students.” “The next semester will be run purely in the online mode so that there is no compromise on the safety and well being of the students.” IITs are for students and students are the priority, their health and their safety is something which is of uttermost importance to them. I remember the licence of the mess facility at hostel 10 was immediately being cancelled as soon as some students were affected with food poisoning. The decisions they take might sound cruel, but it is always for the betterment of their existing and upcoming students. If you are wondering that not everybody can afford or has the equipment for the online lectures and that too for a whole semester then don't worry, here are the words of the director: “A large section of our students come from economically less privileged families and would require a helping hand to equip them with the IT hardware (i.e. laptops and broadband connectivity ) to take these online classes. We look forward to your overwhelming support to help these bright young minds to continue their learning without any further hindrances or delays. We do not want a single student to miss out the learning experience for the lack of money. We have estimated that we need about Rs 5 crores to help those needy students. Our alumni have committed a good amount of support, but that is not enough for all these needy students and I solicit through this message your donations, however small it may be. I am sure that these beneficiaries of your philanthropy will in future contribute significantly to the growth of our Nation.” The only challenge I feel for them and for the students will be the conduction and grading of the exams, but that too could be solved by adapting following measures: Taking LIVE Viva on Video ConferenceTaking LIVE Presentation of their projects through Video ConferenceAssignments (that anyway was homework)Another measure I feel is by conducting an online quiz (MCQ) through say Google Forms. (If you are thinking that how we can avoid copying? Honestly, only the IITians know that in the exams we were allowed to carry a cheat sheet (formula sheet) on which we basically used to scribble everything (probably copying the whole book) with tiniest of handwriting when anyway it never proved to be useful.) Here is a snippet from my farewell poem:Kya yaad hai tujhe?Exams ke woh dinRaat raat bhar padhkeBhool chuke the neend Formula sheet ke naampePuri kitaab likh denaJab ki pata tha humeGhanta farak nahi padna So you see, even these hurdles could be solved.

Professors like Nagendra KrishnaPura, Shanti Pavan selects handful of students for this & you can very well understand the rigor of this course.. To get selected in this focus exclusively of Analog Design basics.. Apart from GATE subjects, try to understand MOSFET design from Razavi.. Practical design experience is helpful.. For Device Modelling Group have basic knowledge on device Physics, EMT & all the other GATE subjects.. This course is also quite good.. Experienced Professors like Amitava Dasgupta, Nandita Dasgupta, Shreepad Karmalkar a are there who are pioneers in the field of Device Physics.. Companies like IBM, Global Foundries, Micron hire a lot of students from this Research Group.. Overall if you are interested in device physics this a great course..

First of all, I hope the curriculum of MTech Clinical Engineering at IITM is well known for you. This course has a quite different structure when compared to a typical MTech program. So what's different about this interdisciplinary course is mainly the institutes which conduct this program. Although this course is offered by IITM, it is jointly conducted by two more top notch institutes of the country, CMC Vellore and SCTIMST Trivandrum. Let me be more clear. In the first semester you will be staying in IITM campus and studying there. In the second semester you will be shifted to CMC Vellore and the third semester will be conducted in Trivandrum. Fourth semester is project time and you will be allowed to choose any one of the three institutes. So having said that, all the three institutes will have a hectic schedule to offer you and eventually it wont be a friendly journey if you are trying to focus on a different goal. Also you will be studying core electronics and biomedical related subjects so it will be really difficult to manage your ESE Civil Engg preparations as both are completely different fields.

But due to the current situation and two months lockdown, many companies have deferred the joining of 2019–20 hires by at least 3–4 months, and thus these students will be joining the firms after October only giving the companies very less time to plan their next recruitment. In this scenario, most of the regular visitors will skip participating in the placement drive due to a lack of vacancies and requirements. Many businesses have suffered losses due to the failing economy of the world, so naturally, the placement season is not going to be as great as it was the previous year. The companies will try to reduce cost and the first thing that they will do is to minimize the hiring. I think AIPC (All IITs Placement Committee) will look into this thing and try to postpone the placement season to sometime in March next year.  I still believe that there will be an ample number of opportunities in the software roles. The CEM (Computer Science, Electrical, Mathematics, and Computing) students will get placed despite the current situation. It’s the students of other branches who will be facing the major trouble.

I have answered this question in Tamil too and you can find it in the link below: Every year scores of IIT and NIT students upon completion of their B. Tech move in for the job or higher studies while the final year students join for the internship. They would be amongst the first and finest grade of students that would be looking for job opportunities after Corona. Job opportunities A month-long placements start at IIT Madras every year in December. 90% of the students end up bagging a job at the end of the first phase of placements. Almost certainly the rest of the students end up with a job by the end of the placements. Owing to the corona pandemic, the economic situation all across the globe is at a complicated state. However, this is not going to affect the students who have already obtained job offers. Unfortunately, job offers for the remaining students may get heavily affected due to COVID-19 and the subsequent almost world-wide lockdown. However, once the lockdown gets lifted, I am certain most of the other students will get a job offer too. The pacifying news amongst this pandemic for the students is that none of the placed students will miss out on their jobs. The same has been requested by IIT authorities to the recruiters and will most likely stand ground, given the importance of IITs towards society in general and a large pool of recruiting companies that set camp in the IITs for recruiting the brightest minds. Higher studies Every year a large number of students set sail abroad for higher studies. The favoured destination amongst students is in USA and European countries like UK and Germany. Due to the current pandemic, some of the universities in the USA have either frozen the application process (as in the case with Stanford University) or have cancelled the admissions for Spring 2020. New York State has, on the other hand, postponed the application to date ahead. Furthermore, availing visa to foreign countries looks like a forlorn dream for now and this has made the students of IITs and NITs fidgety and agitated. Most universities in foreign countries avail research funding from government agencies or via Industries. Due to COVID-19 and the subsequent lockdown economy has stalled and thus it may affect funding situation greatly. We have seen in several instances before that the major hit is taken by the Research and Development sector every time a country faces economic hits. This will stall the progress of students getting admitted in top-notch universities. Internships Internships play a major role in the future of students in future placements as well as for higher studies. Most of the students of IITs and NITs look for greener pastures in international companies and universities for their internships. However, due to the current COVID-19 debacle, 99% of the companies and universities have cancelled their internship offers.

I'm talking strictly with respect to Analog and RF part of Microelectronics specialisation. 1)IITM has Prof Shanthi Pavan, nagendra krishnapura, Qadeer Khan, sankaran Aniruddhan, Saurabh Saxena who are working in Analog,RF,Mixed signal and power management fields. Hence you have more options to choose from according to your interest. In IISC we have only one professor(my guide) working in Analog and RF. Sometimes even he complains to students that he is the only one to teach Analog and integrated ckts for wireless communication courses. He wants another faculty in this field so that he can handover this basic courses to that faculty and he can teach some advance courses like PLL and Power amplifiers. 2) Due to more faculties, the no of courses that are being offered in this field are more as compared to what we are getting here. In IITM, you will get a) Analog IC Design B) VLSI data conversion systems C)PLL D) Power management ICs E) Radio frequency integrated circuits Mtech people can easily complete all courses in 1 year. However, here in IISC due to only one professor Mtech people can take only 2 courses because that professor teaches 1 course per semester (bcoz of heavy research work) 3) Quality of professors. Here in IISC, my guide has really a huge knowledge base and he teaches everything from practical point of view(because he has 10 years industry experience from Intel and Qualcomm). His courses are challenging and the course project that he gives is super tough. But wait, in IITM you have atleast 4–5 professors like that. Having 4 Roger federers in your team as compared to only 1 can completely turn the things. 4) Time. With great resources comes a great responsibility. The course which my guide offers is really time consuming and requires you to put tremendous efforts. You can say that this course is equivalent to 2 normal courses. Now imagine taking 3 courses like this per semester in IITM. Your life will become hell. You won't be having time for yourself. They will make sure that you don't have time for extracurricular activities (you can have but your time management skills need to be on another level). Initially becuase of enthusiasm you will enjoy that but after sometime you will start hating it. You don't have time for relaxing yourself. Not many people can cope up with such a pressure. In IISC, you will have time for yourself. You can relax and you won't be killed under academic pressure. Campus Life is superb and the greenery here will make you feel like you are living and studying in jungle😛. If you are hardworking enough then you can keep yourself busy for all the time but don't expect a driving force which can keep you pushing in IISC. 5) Pulling the best version of yourself out of you. If you cope up with the pressure then you can say that IITM professors will pull out best from you. These professors reply to your doubts and queries on email by replying then back at 2 am and 3 am at night. No doubt why they expect more hardwork from you. 6) PHD project. This is my personal opinion and I have made it after comparing research papers from our group with that of Ics(integrated ckts and systems group where all the above mentioned professors work). The amount of research papers that one publishes during his/her PhD in IITM is greater than one can publish in IISC. However, if you look into PHD projects of students under Prof gaurab banerjee, he literally pushes you to fabricate the whole chip and not one,two but he forces you to design all the components. No wonder why you can see whole transceiver designed by only one student single handedly. This type of exposure and the trust that Prof. Gaurab Banerjee provides you, I think nobody can provide. He is more like your friend and he has zero arrogance. He doesn't try to show dominance over you. Now why did I choose IISC over IITM because it seems IITM is great place? Because I wanted to do my PHD at such a place where I have my freedom, I can have time for myself, I can enjoy my life along with studies so as to cope up with the mental pressure one has to bear while pursuing PhD. I just falled in love with my professor when he was taking my interview. He was helping me whenever I was stuck at some steps. He was literally pushing me towards final goal. He was encouraging me whenever I was giving correct answers. I thought that if placement is not an issue then he is an ideal guy under whom you can pursue your PHD. After going through his past PHD student's linkedin profile, I found out that all of them are placed in very good companies like samsung, Qualcomm etc. That was the moment I decided that I will go further with IISC for my PHD and after offer later came , I cancelled my tickets to Kanpur and Madras where my MS/PHD interview was scheduled. But wait. What about the knowledge that I would have got if I had chosen IITM?? No worries boss. Those people are kind enough to upload video lectures of all the courses on their site. This is how I'm utilizing my quarantine period😉😉 All the best for your future!! I have tried to convey maximum points. I hope these will help you in your final decision :-) Sorry for any grammatical mistakes!! ",0.9992,Positive,5,0.11494252873563218,1,5

My suggestion is if you are going for a research-based course(MS/MTech-Res/PhD), the institute is secondary and the professor you work with is primary. As far as you’re joining IISc or any of the top 5 IITs, it should be fine. If you know your research area beforehand, please check which department has a better set of faculties in that domain. In case you don’t know your research area, then you might choose the better institute. And if you’re going for Mtech then you can check the placement statistics and go for the best department.

Then in case of a tie(which almost always happens) the GPA is considered.Thus a priority order is created. Some important rules are that 1) only 10% of students may enter a branch 2)only 10% students may exit a branch. But the most interesting rule is as follows Consider a student from Biotech wanting to shift to EP. Let's say he has a GPA of say 8.9 with a A grade and a S grade and is listed in priority order with rank 29. Also EP has not satisfied its 10% branch change quota. But owing to his bad luck , he is not able to be in the top 10% cgpa holders of the biotech department (who are eligible for branch change) which rules him out of the branch change race. Now what this rule says is that any student ranked with a rank lower than 29 is automatically not eligible for changing branch to EP even though EP has free seats and the other candidate is in the top 10% of his branch. Regarding EP this year , only 1 student changed his branch to EP despite EP being able to accept atleast 7 candidates (as 4 students left EP) The student had S grades in both MA1101 and PH1010 and GPA of around 9.2(sorry , i am not sure about his GPA; but certainly higher than mine :)) So this would be the cutoff.

SPCOM not so sure. VLSI you will not get call. But Kanpur you will receive in SPCOM and RF. New IITs like Jodhpur, Indore, Dhanbad probably you will get VLSI in the end for MTech. IIT Gandhinagar and Bhubaneswar you will get an interview call. But don't know whether they will conduct interviews this year because of COVID19.

287,287,Indian-Institute-of-Technology-Madras-IITM,What device did IIT and AIIMS alumni invent to stop coronavirus? How does it work?,1,1,1/1,No,Followed,2020-03-21,https://www.quora.com/What-device-did-IIT-and-AIIMS-alumni-invent-to-stop-coronavirus-How-does-it-work-1,"The Indian Institute of Technology (IIT)- Delhi has developed an “infection-proof fabric” to be used at hospitals to prevent hospital-acquired infections (HAIs). The development by “Fabiosys Innovations”, a start-up incubated at IIT-Delhi, comes at a time when the world is dealing with the deadly coronavirus outbreak. However, the team has been working on the project for over a year with support from the government’s Department of Science and Technology. According to official statistics from the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, for every 100 hospitalised patients in developing countries, 10 acquire HAIs and the risk is even higher at the time of a coronavirus outbreak. The team claims to have developed an affordable, novel textile-processing technology, which converts regular cotton fabric into infection-proof fabric. As per Department of Textile and Fibre Engineering, IIT-Delhi: rolls of cotton fabric are treated with a set of proprietary-developed chemicals under a set of particular reaction conditions, using the machinery already commonly available in textile industries. The fabric, after undergoing these processes, gains the powerful antimicrobial functionality. What is interesting about the Fabiosys’ fabric is that even after washing multiple times, it does not lose its functionality. This fabric can be stitched into various articles such as bedsheets, the uniforms for patients, doctors and nurses and even curtains. The fabric satisfies the Indian washing standards in terms of number of washing. It is also completely non-toxic and affordable. IIT has collaborated with the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) for a pilot run of the product. While talking to a few patients at the AIIMS, the IIT researchers came to know that they became more sick after getting admitted there. While researching, they found that hospital-acquired infections (HAIs) are a grave problem, especially in developing countries like India, where the tropical climatic conditions are suitable for the growth of bacteria. It was surprising to see that many patients are not even aware about HAIs. People usually become aware of any cross-contamination when it has already taken the form of an outbreak or epidemic. The recent case of coronavirus is one such example. One of the major ways these infections spread is through contact from contaminated surfaces and a patient in a hospital is surrounded by a variety of fabric in the form of bedsheets, the uniforms for patients, doctors and nurses etc. and these textile surfaces actually become the breeding ground for pathogens, which do not get killed even while washing in hot water. The research team of IIT-Delhi is currently in the process of conducting large-scale manufacturing trials in the Delhi-NCR region in collaboration with AIIMS, Delhi to pilot these products. The team is also in early talks with some of the largest hospital chains in India for further pilots and strategic collaborations. They have been financially supported by the Department of Science and Technology, Ministry of Human Resource Development, IIT Delhi and Department of Biotechnology in the form of grants and fellowships.

But do not loose your heart friend. Your rank is quite decent. You have chances to get in to some very good options and opportunities. Let me give a chance to explore for you… Here are some very good options… Apply for normal MS program of IIT Madras which is as good as TI MS. But make sure to apply in VLSI and SPCOM only. And in VLSI go only for Digital Domain where you will find ample amount of opportunities. If you wish to go in to analog than consider only if you get Professor Shanti Pavan or Professor Nagendra Krishnapura as your mentor. Otherwise don't consider. Your life will be hell in Analog Domain with very less opportunities.Next option is to get in to NIT Allahabad which you will get at this rank. But try to get in to top 3 NITs if possible. Might get in spot round.If you don't have money problem than consider IIIT Hyderabad, BITS Pilani Rajasthan, IIIT Delhi, IIIT Bangalore. Consider only VLSI and Data Science courses as your specialisation from these colleges.Also you can get IIT Kanpur MS in VLSI. Apply in SPCOM and VLSI. You can definitely get it after interview.Apply for IIT Bombay 3 year RA course. If you are lucky than probably you might end up in IIT Bombay. As process requires written and interview. Because you never knows when your luck is going to shine. Just have faith and apply for it.IIT Delhi apply in CARE and RFDT probably get call. But that IIT is difficult.Apply in IIT Hyderabad in SPCOM, VLSI and Machine learning. Although IIT Hyderabad has very less number of seats. But in spot round there is a huge chance for it. Because mostly people do not take IIT Hyderabad. But these courses are good and Placement are also good.Hopefully this might sort your life till some point. And at last I just want to say don't loose hope. You have a pretty decent rank and congratulations for it. Don't worry just trust the process and cheer up. You will end up getting something good. Because we only can do our work and explore the opportunities. Rest is given by Supreme Master.

One more thing if you get a call than congratulations you do not need to worry about your low Gate Score because once the bare minimum cutofc is crossed it totally depends on written test taken by Department and on your performance in the interview. Also I want to add a last point you will receive call from IIT Kanpur MS. MS of IIT Kanpur is not usually famous as IIT Madras so Thier cutoffs are even lower than Madras. So you can expect a call from Kanpur. And it totally depends on your interview performance. So once you get the call just prepare hard and nail the target.

But I'll try to mention some of the best creations of IIT Madras. The thing I like the most in IIT Madras is it's cutting age technology and ground breaking research technology. NIRF 1 Rank holder in Research is not a joke. The Researchers here work all day long and burn their midnight oil to provide the best creations of their research work. IIT Madras is improving it's placement offers day by day. More and more number of postgrad students are getting placed. And if you ask me I'll be happier to serve people with my civil engineering knowledge and so I aim to become a professor and a good Researcher also. Every activity taking place in IIT Madras is a bud to innvent a new creation. Well the mechanical engineering department has invented a standing wheel chair also. So what else a student needs to develop a teen into a thinking adult is their in the campus of IIT Madras. I hope I've answered your question well to your expectations. Lots of love and power to you.

Later stages -> Some of my besties had BFs and they insisted me to have GF to know what Love is ! I had a fair idea of proposing to someone who speak my language and also from a technical background. Motivation and Information When I was in the first year of my PhD at IIT Madras, my sister got married. My parents started telling me that their duty will be over if I get married. I also agreed to the same. I told that “Choice is mine and I will go for Love cum Arranged Marriage"". Immediately my mom puts forth a condition stating that you need to find a girl from our community only. I obliged to the condition and said that I will start my search. One fine evening, every one from my maternal side gathered in my uncle's home near IIT and i was invited for dinner. I went to meet all to have good time and again they started about marriage topic. My aunt gives an information that they went to their distant relative’s place for a holiday and stayed in their home for a couple of days. There the host had two children and the elder one is a girl with spec who is an engineer and worked for a MNC and pursuing masters during that time. My aunt told me that “she will be a best partner for you”. Search for my girl The information given to me didn't allow my heart and mind to sleep. As usual my aunt instilled the info in a way it made me curious. “How to find her ?” is what scrolling on my forehead. Don't know the name and no contact info given to me. I have no intention to ask about the details. I came to know about the relationship tree of their families and somehow found their family name. Now started searching social media about the same with the only keyword. Facebook search yielded me many names with same family name. I was going through each and every profile to find who she is and get connected. After a through search, i could not find anyone due to missing display picture. I was little frustrated. The same day during night i started my search operation and i found her cousin's profile who was my cousin's BIL. Nature gives us Right Information at Right Time. I went through his friend list and found my girl's profile. Proposal and Acceptance After locating the profile, immediately gave a friend request. The time was past 23:00 Hrs IST. I kept watching the facebook page and refreshed it often. Fifteen minutes passed by and i had a notification. OMG she had accepted my friend request. I went to cloud nine. I immediately went to messenger from the profile and started typing. Greetings followed by few Introductory messages. Desperately waiting for her reply. I got a very professional response and followed by a Bye. I didn't disturb her and went to sleep happily. Next day, I was online to chat with her and she came online around the same time. Exchanged greetings and she told me that she is doing assignments. I asked for appointment to chat and she replied “whenever you find me online next day, chat with me”. Next day came, I was waiting online as she created eagerness to chat. She came online around 23 Hrs IST. As usual we exchanged greetings and I directly started saying why I gave her friend request and asked her why she accepted my request. She gave me the answer that her maternal uncle attended her cousin's marriage (in deed my cousin's marriage too) and took my Photograph and sent to her. I remember that gentleman who was nice to me interacting and asked for photo. I asked whether she attended the marriage and she answered no. I knew by that time she has seen my latest picture and I found her old profile pic with slight out of focus and less clarity. Without hesitation, I asked for lot of details about her stating that I wanted to know as I am proposing for a marriage. She didn't respond me and went offline. Note that she didn't give her contact details except FB connection. I was online for a week waiting for her to come online but she didn't. I was thinking that I might have made a mistake by asking too much details in a go but it was mandatory for both. Days passed by and one fine day I got a message from her with sorry and she expressed that my questions and request for details were correct. She answered to my questions and this confirmed my proposal and her acceptance to the same (Still didn't propose directly). Confirmation and subsequent story We exchanged numbers and started chatting by messages. Then moved to WhatsApp. One fine weekend, I received a message that she wanted to speak to me and after a long hesitation, I said okay we can speak. She called me and I was nervous as it was the first time to talk directly. We spoke for fifteen minutes and out of blue she asked me when will you propose ? I replied that I had already proposed in the chat. She didn't accept that and asked for proposal via phone. I went ahead saying “I Love You My Wife” and received a blushing response “Love you too My Hubby”. Chats became mandatory and we were always on call via Reliance - Thanks to Ambani ! After few months our families exchanged horoscopes and went ahead with meeting between parents leading to fixing marriage date and so on. This all happened without any meeting of myself with my fiancee ! The meeting happened just few weeks before marriage and that can be a separate story - as it is more interesting and lengthy. Got married and settled near IIT and I received a hike in scholarship due to HRA (wink). Love stories continues forever. We can find many interesting love stories that happened in IITs. Mine was first in my lab and subsequently my lab mates also had love cum arranged marriages. Love is Life | Live to Love | Love to Live Happy Moments ! ",0.9996,Positive,5,0.1839080459770115,1,5

So , in that queue , there was a heavenly beautiful girl sitting just next to me and I don't know why I got a feeling that she is the one🙃, for the whole time I was noticing her and thinking from what branch she would be ,what would be her name but I couldn't gather the courage to have a talk with her. After that, during the orientation program, there were auditions happening for different clubs and me and my one friend were going to audition for a music club as we both play guitar but on the way I saw there were auditions going on for the dance club and there was she going to audition for the dance group, then to the very first instant I told my friend to go ahead as I will audition for the dance club and then she danced I was like omg 😦 she is a too good dancer and then many more people auditioned for it and my all hopes were shattered because they were pro level dancers and I saw no chance of me getting into that group but I wanted to join that group by any means as I wanted to spend some more time with her and then I audition even after knowing that there is no chance of mine . After 2 days the results came and there was no name of mine as expected but at late night I got a call from a senior that I was hold on a standby and the very next day I was in the crew 😁 shocked. In the first meeting of our group we have to introduce ourselves in which I came to know that she was from the same branch CSE as mine🙂 and to the very surprise even our birth dates were same , everyone one in the crew was shocked and one of my senior told us that destiny has something for us . And then we were asked about our relationship status an then my all hopes were shattered as she told that she was in a long distance relationship. But I moved on . But then , as the time passed we spent a lot of time together as we both have similar interests, and we became very very good friends as we spend most of time in college together we even went to IIT Roorkee for the competition but deep down I still had feelings for her but I didn't told her . But at the end of the semester , she told me that she broke up , I was happy and sad at the same time I was happy because now there was no one else and sad because she had very serious relationship and she really loved him and she was broken . and then after two months , on valentine's Day exactly at 12 a.m I told her everything about my feelings for her even after knowing that she will deny it but I couldn't control myself and I told her and she told me exactly what was expected she said she is not into any kind of relationship with anyone as she still was not moved on from her ex but all this didn't affected our friendship we still spend a lot of time together , we had also done some nightouts together after that and then this Corona pandemic came and we are sitting at our homes but we are connected as we play pubg together🙃 .

Professors are Humble and Very simple. Now comes to Your question Integrated Circuit MTech program is highly recommended department of IIT Madras. If you are a placement oriented student than I will suggest you to go and do Subjects in Digital Integrated Circuit and only few courses related to Analog. As the Analog Domain requires lots of Hardwork but the fruits you will get is not much. On the other hand Digital Domain is great. You will be getting lots of opportunities in various big Fortune 500 companies like Intel, Qualcomm, Samsung, Cisco, Google Hardware, Apple Hardware… These are not only Fortune 500 but ranked pretty high in the list. Where As if you are from Analog you will get opportunities in Texas Instruments, Analog Devices sometimes AMD will also hire. And rest small Semiconductor companies. And that too I have seen people from Analog Domain are struggling till Day 2 of placements. Before placements some people from Analog Domain are so overconfident that they were thinking they are the best. But once the companies started registration in IIT Madras and other IITs they don't have options to fill. Only few companies open Analog positions. And the companies I have mentioned except Texas Instruments none of the companies ranked within top 300 of Fortune 500 list. Texas Instruments also ranked close to 200. So for overconfident people I must say please don't make inferior to someone because in the end when time comes every one will come to know who is more superior. Coming to important subject which most of them do in ICS are Digital IC design (Professor Janakiraman)DSP Mapping Algorithm (Professor Nitin ChandraChoodan)Advanced VLSI design in Digital Circuits (Professor Janakiraman)Semiconductor Device Modelling (Prof. Nandita Das Gupta)Analog Circuit (Professor Shanti Pavan or by Professor Nagendra Krishnapura)Digital Signal Processing ( Professor Aravind)Analog IC designDSP Architecture and Embedded systemsThese are few courses which one used to do. But your placement mainly depends on Course No. 1, 2, 3, 8… These 4 courses will help you like hell during placements. Specifically the course number 1 and 3… They are the backbone of 80% students targeting Hardware Domain. Also you can refer my other answer where I have described the difference in n the number of vacancies coming for Placements in Digital Domain and the number of Vacancies coming for Analog Domain. But 1 thing I must say two Professor in Analog Domain like Professor Shanti Pavan and Professor Nagendra Krishnapura are Gems which you will find only in IIT Madras. If you are doing MTech project under them than no need to worry about placements. There is no company in the world who would say no to their students, I am talking of semiconductor Companies… Regards, Singh Nikhil ",0.9966,Positive,5,0.13793103448275862,1,5

Honestly, Germans should stop guilt-tripping the rest of the world for what the Nazis did and how they supported it during WW2. Yes, they have experience with Nazis, but that doesn't make them experts on internal politics of India. You have all the right to go on a guilt-trip, but don't make us share your burden. Whatever might be the pros and cons of CAA, it was democratically passed in a parliament. We have other institutions to keep the executive under check, we aren't Nazis. Nazis were in Germany and that's that. It is crossing a line when a random German dude compares a democratically elected head of state to Hitler. Indians fought in the war to liberate the world from the Nazis. We don't need your sermons, period. It's become fancy among the Western news portals to pontificate 'lesser democracies' like India on the ideas of liberty, secularism this and that. Well, Indians are smart enough to decide things for themselves. We don't need your lessons on democracy, thank you. And the guy violated Visa rules, and the government kicked him out. The Western countries don't even let the people from developing countries in to their country without myriad checks, and million visa conditions. Why should Indians tolerate when a random student on a visa issued for educational purposes violates it? He was given the visa for educating himself, not for educating Indians on Fascism.

Food for thought: if he had participated in pro CAA-NRC marches, would we have taken action? Sorry. No prizes for the right answer on this question :)  Late edit: So many commenters saying “oh but he broke the visa rules”. I do not want to respond to each. So here goes a common response. First, I said that already. I know that technically he was in violation of visa rules. Did you not read that part? Btw, have you asked for cancellation of the visa for Akshay Kumar for making a statement on the protests? If not, hurry. That is one more issue for you to outrage. Second, there is no need to get holier than thou as if you have never violated rules ever in your life. When you cross a road where there is no zebra crossing marked you are in violation. How many times have you been punished for that? Jailed? Detained? Third, there is need to have a sense of proportion. I think that expelling someone is an overreaction that does not befit a country that has pretentions of being a world power, being civilised, and being a democracy. Fourth, protests are valid and there are a zillion cases where Indians living abroad have been part of protests. Without repercussions. And don't cite Sudan or Pakistan. These countries cannot be your role models. Fifth, if you are celebrating people of Indian origin taking part in rallies or talking in support of CAA when abroad, you are just being hypocrites.

Because MS students are bound to do courses decided by their guides so Placement becomes difficult for MS in communication and signal processing. MTech students in Communication and Signal Processing are not bound to do courses in Communication and Signal Processing only. They can do 5 to 6 electives which most of them do either in CS or in VLSI. So their placement is 100%. Where MS students are allowed to do 5 courses which is decided by guide and they will allow to do only Communication and Signal Processing related courses. So there placement chances decrease drastically. Mostly they will go in software companies. So try to take MS in Madras only that too in VLSI. But if you want to take MTech than you can take VLSI ofcourse but also you can take Communication and Signal Processing. Because these two streams witnessed 100% placement this year for MTech. With VLSI averaging over 22 lacs. And Communication averaging over 25 lacs for MTech The main reason for very good Placement is less strength so students have options to choose from companies. Also I have seen companies even have taken 6 pointers at above 15 lacs. Literally they are fighting for students as they have very selective options during placements. Where as at IIT Kanpur so much strength is there and even with 8 pointers people are struggling till 8th day. Some of them have to choose very low package companies.

It's average is almost touching 25 lacs in both department.In CS companies like Micron, JD even took 5 pointers easily. As these companies visited day 2.2 but till than all the good students got placed. So they don't have options to select from so in CS if you are less than 5.5 also than companies will take you because they don't have choice left.But in EE you have to be atleast 6 for getting good job. I have seen people in EE with pointers around 6.5 or less getting jobs in Marvel semiconductor, HCL with salary around 12 to 20 lacs. As these companies visited day 3 and 4. So they also don't left with good option. So they have to choose from leftover students.And if you are above 7 than till day 2.1 almost every one get good offers above 20 lacs.So many companies visited for EE like Qualcomm, Intel, Samsung, Cisco, AMD, Mediatek, Micron, Microsoft etc and all the companies which you even don't have heard the names. All these giants have offered above 20 lacs CTC.So these are some reasons to join old 5 IITs. Because even if you are below average student you can get a jaw dropping salaries.

Now if you see the answers below especially the brilliant one by Mr. Anbazhagan who typifies Tamil DK spirit in name and words, and then it gathering 1K votes in no time, possibly DMK quora users were asked to upvote it, the answer is pretty clear. The question asked above is one set up for the answer and is a ploy of the so called Tamils of TN. BTW, many of the DK and its branch Tamils (they call themselves Tamils) most often speak Telegu at home. That is the truth of TN politics. Coming to IIT Madras. It is one place where corruption is controlled even with OBC quota creation in 2005. While the OBC students are clearly selected by merit, many of them especially the rich Tamil brand in them, have supporters in TN who will like to belittle IITM any time something interesting catches up and will like to protest in front of IIT Madras campus. Well that is exactly the DK, DMK ideology since IIT Madras was called way back in the 70s and 80s, calling it as Pappan College (Pappan is a loose word created by the great Periyar of DK fame to refer to Brahmins, since Pappa (child) was used by the great poet Subramanya Bharathi in his poetry and since Bharathi was a Brahmin. It is a pity that we forget that Bharathi was a freedom fighter of India and Periyar preferred British rule!). Why was IIT a Brahmin college? Since the next best college in TN, Guindy Engg. College (now called as Anna University…well Guindy was certainly miles ahead of AU since AU today has many silly branches in various locations, but that is beyond the topic!) was controlled by the Upper Class OBC group. I again repeat the word Upper Class! Guindy seats were saleable even though there was nothing like payment seat in Guindy ever. So the politicians (DMK) could make money doing the unscrupulous act. You couldn’t do that in IIT. Indira Gandhi’s sons could not have got an IIT seat ever! Again until 2005, reservation did not exist in IIT, while Guindy is the typical example of 68% reservation that prevails in TN. All in all, in TN about 5% (some claim 3 or 4%) are Brahmins. However as I have discussed in other places 95% of this 5% will stand ahead of the top 5% of the rest in TN in basic intelligence. (Well DK, its child DMK and their cousins state that this is because Brahmins did not let the others learn for 1000 years, probably because they had done radioactive dating of the activity! LOL!) So the typical Tamil Brahmin in those days had to either fight for the seat in Guindy or get into IIT Madras which was easier. Yours faithfully, got into IIT Madras (did not go to other IITs when I got a lower rank after 11th standard) after Plus 2 (12th standard) but yet I find pride in having got a seat in Guindy (Mechanical) and yet keep proof of the offer. Why? Since, getting into IIT was about intelligence, getting into Guindy was about the ability to get almost perfect scores in Maths, Physics, Chemistry in the board exam. An uncle of mine asked me to go to Guindy since the branch was Mech, but I had a sane brother a Prof in IIT Madras who first stopped me from going to other IITs after 11th (since if I did not find it fine living there I will have to come back and complete 12th before I get any seat!) and who told me to join IITM even though my available choice of branch was in Aero, Civil, Metallurgy, Naval. I yet relish having done Aero in IITM followed by a CS in IISc. IIT Madras is certainly my pride. Since not only did I study my B.Tech there, I studied in the local school Vana Vani from 3rd standard. I lived in the campus with my brother as he had quarters there. I also relish visiting the Sri Jalakanteswarar temple there even today. So IIT Madras means a lot to me. Does the above anyway say anything about my Tamilian feeling. I am proud of my mother tongue. I am a Hindi hater, primarily since I had to learn that as second language from 3rd to 12th. Now where am I coming to? India is a diverse country. Indian psyche is absolutely multifaceted since we are diverse people. So I might support IIT but will sit with Karunanidhi (if he was there) supporting Tamil language. However the so called Tamil people is a mystery. Go down to south TN and people are different from those say around Chennai. Now in India the diversity is so vast that you cant conclude anything since the same action is felt differently by different people based on caste, religion, language etc. Finally the most messy problem today is Tamil brahmins no longer have to concentrate and get into IIT like in my times, since back then there were just a Guindy plus 8 colleges, total seats being around 800 approx and 32% available to forward castes, where again given the state board exam being a rote system, many OBC would have taken the seats. So a brahmin had to fight for that 240 seats or so. Today there are VITs and SRMs and multitude of other institutions. So why struggle for the IIT seat? As for the OBCs, they could not master the JEE and since in TN, lots of college options exist, why will they struggle to get even the OBC seat in IIT. You cram the state board exam (which in my times had 95.5% in MPC as Guindy seat and today you need 99.9999% for the same seat…so you see how methodologically the state board exam has become, where you mug and vomit…not that CBSE is much better!). In summary, IIT Madras in my times had at least 30% Tamilians, mostly brahmins (pappan college). Today that must have reduced. The college deficient, underdeveloped (also called BIMAROU) states have their higher intelligent slogging guys get into IITs. As a side thought, even in Karnataka which is the pioneer of private engineering colleges hardly anyone gets into IITs. Even then, compared to Karnataka, TN yet had much better throughput into IITs. If you check in the FIITJEE site for ranks in JEE advanced you will find better output from TN than Karnataka. Well the TN set would end up being 95% brahmins is an understatement. In summary, IIT Madras is a pride for the one who managed to get in there. It certainly is not a pride for those who were not able to get in. There is a story in Tamil about a fox trying to get grapes. When it failed, it said “che che intha pazham pulikkum” meaning these grapes are sour. That is the reason why many of these so called proclaimed Tamilians will claim that IIT Madras is not TN pride. ",0.9975,Positive,5,0.11494252873563218,1,5

I’m proud that a Tamil scientist is in charge of the project.  Lack of awareness- IIT-Madras is under MHRD and the entrance is only through JEE Advanced, which is not even known to majority of the population. Tamil Nadu counselling works through marks in board exams, while IIT admissions works only through entrance exams, that too set in the most toughest scale. While things are getting changed with time, the coaching centres are also parallely using the awareness a business model- Sad thing. Unless a guy like Super 30 Anand takes up an initiative and make the doors of IIT open for a common man, there won’t be any change.  When media uses IIT-M only as a source of attention- Thanks to the media, we are only in limelight because of frequent suicides, Ambedkar-Periyar study circle protests and hosting Helipad when Modiji visited Tamil Nadu. In fact, the projects undertaken by IIT-Madras and its startups for Tamil Nadu government not even gets mentioned anywhere.  Its common for any institute- Its not only the case of Tamil Nadu alone. It happens everywhere. Indians are proud of Sundar Pichai, but I don’t feel people of West Bengal will be proud for IIT-Kharagpur that produced him.  So the question by itself has a flaw. So even if the 0.05% of the Tamil population that has this pride(out of which 90% will be students studying in the institute) will lose in future, it won’t even matter. Thus, the pride doesn’t matter. I will be happier as long as the funding to the institute for research doesn’t stop. P.S. Sorry that I had to disable comments because few people who were spewing casteist venom without sanity. I welcome all the discussions through DM Points to ponder- @Dharun Senthilkumar (தருண் செந்தில்குமார்) bro has given a great insight. JEE is conducted only in English and Hindi, leaving out a large section of Tamil Medium students. This also a major factor of why IIT isn't famous for most in the state.

First of all, in this age of information boom, anything will be twisted and presented to fit into any narrative. I have personally talked with the student twice or thrice and don’t know much about her or why exactly she took the unfortunate decision to kill herself. May peace be upon the poor soul. The current discourse in the media is completely fabricated and exaggerated that it took the issue of mental health in IITs to that of caste violence and Islamophobia. The words of her parents have to be surely taken into account but again it's filled with emotions and hearsays that one shouldn’t fully immerse into it. The girl clearly had personal issues, she used to cry in the mess hall and was an introvert who didn’t talk much with people. IIT M is a cruel place filled with toxic cut-throat competition and one can feel helpless and alienated. This is an active issue that the administration is not taking seriously and has caused over 5 deaths in the past year. Not to mention she was the topper of HSEE exam conducted by IITM for admission into the MA programme and stood first among her peers in internal exams. According to the alleged note, retrieved from her mobile, which hasn’t been produced before the police yet, she has blamed three professors - Sudarshan Padmanabhan, Hemchandra Karah and Milind Brahme. Now whatever be the issues she had faced under them, it has to be properly investigated. Again resorting to name-calling, building up theories and personal attacks against the accused do no good. Sudarshan Padmanabhan is a philosophy professor and dealt with the Logic course for the first-year students of the HS department. Her mother said her daughter has said the professor used to make people cry during their presentations and she was stressed about the same. As someone who did the same course, I find some truth in this, the prof was quite stringent on the standards and strongly refuted invalid points students make in the class. But it ends there, he wasn’t harsh nor he carried this outside the classroom. Again the girl said to her mother that she got 13/20 for the quiz and she deserved 5 more marks which the prof didn’t give. Again one must remember that she was the topper in the course and grading in IITs are relative meaning she doesn’t have anything to lose there. Media reports now show he was disgusted with her Muslim name and she was forced not to wear a hijab to prevent her identity. This is absolute bollocks!! Even her classmates say she was one of the prof’s favourite student and both talked to lengths about American politics in the class hours. She didn’t wore hijab even at her home!. Again Sudarshan is the kind of prof who always smiles at former students outside classrooms and offers to buy tea or snacks. Even during one of our exams, which got extended beyond class hours he arranged snacks and tea under his own expense! But alas, he has a stereotypical name that one can easily fit into Islamophobia narrative and it is done blatantly here! Before anyone accuses him of a sanghi, a small look into his works and activities shows he’s academically liberal oriented. Milind Brahme who handles German again was in the forefront to organise condolence meeting as well as hold departmental level introspection after the incident, for the mental welfare of students as well as academic stress. A JNU alumnus and a politically left-oriented man like him being accused in this death is confusing! Hemchandra Karah is the most unfortunate one in all this hullabaloo. He is physically disabled and why would such a man even think of harassing a disadvantaged student when he himself is one. Woke social media warriors are associating her death to that of Rohit Vemuala while forgetting the same prof had suspended his class and held an active discussion about his suicide with the students when the issue erupted in 2017. One of the freshies had told that the same man has held a welcome kind of party for the students in his home, last month and the girl had got 20/20 for the quizzes! This is nothing but an unfortunate turn of events that got hijacked by certain interests to portray IITM as a Brahamnical agrahara which is Islamophobic and to push the general narrative of how the country is intolerant. IITM has a Muslim prayer hall and a Christian community hall to serve the interests of the minority students. The IITM admin has surely downplayed the issue of mental health of students which needs to be addressed and understood but this is getting drowned in the whole narrative of the structural caste discrimination and Islamophobia. Do these exist in IITM — possible but at an individual level and not that the entire system is conspiring for that. Again the death is truly unfortunate and proper investigation needs to be done including any personal issues she had experienced, but the people around are only interested in jumping the bandwagon!!

He also added that efforts to saffronise educational institutions must be given up and all possible efforts must be taken to treat all students equally in institutions including the IIT.  This is only the most recent incident, in a chain of similar unfortunate events, plaguing the Indian Universities recently. “IIT Madras is an educational agraharam of Brahmins,” Mr. Narayanan, the director of Change India, a Chennai-based centre for advocacy and research, had earlier commented. This has often spurred student bodies such as the Ambedkar-Periyar Study Circle (APSC), founded in 2014, into protesting against the perceived bias.  In May this year, Payal Tadvi, a medical student at BYL Nair General Hospital in Mumbai, committed suicide, alleging vicious casteist slurs cast by her peers.  The 2016 suicide of PhD scholar Rohith Vemula at the Hyderabad Central University sparked a nationwide fury. His suicide note had alleged bias against scheduled castes (a group deemed untouchable till the practice was banned in India) students and blamed top university officials and politicians for perpetuating the bias. While the ruling politcal party & the corporate funding propagated a form of divisive, hate fuelled politics, using love jihad and gauraksha as instruments of coercion - the impact it had on the society will have devasting effects on lives, for a long long time  Sudarshan Padmanabhan is the cause of my death,” Fathima Latheef, a 19-yr-old topper in prestigious Indian Institute Technology wrote in her suicide note.

Life as an HS student is, simply put, chill. Of course, people have different opinions, but by no means is HS the busiest or the toughest course. HS junta are very active in the cultural sphere and other student bodies, despite being a very small department. We do not have lab sessions and instead spend time reading books and writing essays. No student is blatantly discriminated according to his department in the institute but every department is stereotyped to varying degrees. On a positive note, HS students are considered to be very proficient in English and General Knowledge. Some tech students even believe that we have a good sense of fashion. The most common stereotype against HS students is that we do not have much work, academic or otherwise, to do. This obviously is not true. (see - Do you get any free time at all studying humanities and social sciences in IIT Madras?) There are a few people who do not consider humanities students as pure ‘IITians’. But most change this view after a few interactions with HS guys. There are many engineering students who are genuinely interested in HS courses and regret not joining some humanities program. Nevertheless, HS students are given equal opportunity in non-techincal campus bodies and are never sidelined just because they come from a non-engineering background. Life is good for HS people.

What IISERs give you an edge at is the environment, as the IISERs are more research-oriented, and thus offer a mindset suited for that, as well as peers with similar goals as yourself. This can be helpful for some people. Some of the old IITs offer established facilities, which some of the newest IISERs may currently be lacking on their own (i.e., they are using the facilities of some other colleges that they are operating from). This offers a sense of security which is important for some people. Lastly, physics is a vast field. While the research work of the individual faculty members shall not have a huge impact on your undergraduate studies, it is surely nice to have some professors working in areas of your interest, whom you could talk to, for guidance. Also, getting a look at the kind of work they do would be a good first-hand impression, for those who may not be fully sure about their interest in that particular field of physics. So, the final factor is areas of research. This you would need to look into yourself, and decide which place can offer you the best set of potential mentors, guides, and even friends. :) So, to conclude, there isn’t a clear cut answer to your question that shall be applicable for all. Based on your needs, and based on the options you finally get, you should be the one to decide which college shall be better suited for you. You can definitely become a physicist by pursuing your Bachelor’s and Master’s from any of the IISERs or IITs, but where do you think would you be most comfortable and satisfied at?

As my current friends from control are allowed in almost every company which are open for MTech. Last year control seniors are placed in Intel, Micron and Mathworks. Secondly in IIT Madras placements are good because here nobody has compulsion that you have to do only control courses.

IIT Madras has started allowing M.Tech students to pursue internships only a couple of years back and hence, the M.Tech Internship Process is not very well established in terms of timeline and recruiters. However, almost all students in M.Tech CSE get a good internship from campus internship process. ",0.6314,Positive,5,0.13793103448275862,1,5

Chemical engineering MTech is not at all good in IITs. As most of the students in MTech are from normal college. They don't have coding skills. So they are ruled out of coding jobs (Which very few companies allow them to sit). Also core jobs in chemical engineering is very few for MTech with very less package. Most of the students in old IITs chemical engineering and Civil engineering are struggling to find a good job. Either they go out unplaced or most of them join PhD in some other IITs just to remove unemployment for 5 years (Atleast they will be getting 35k stipend) and in this way they can fool their relatives for 5 years by saying “Abhi toh PhD kar rha/rhi Hun"". Also these 5 years help those students to get laid 😜… As in the name of PhD their parents get marriage proposals for boys(Girls ke liye koi problem nahi hai 😂😂 .

Once they gets married they can get laid 😂😂… Or fir apni duniya basa lete hai IIT ke Quarters Mai for 5 long years… 😆😆… MTech is not a good option for Chemical Engineering students. If you still don't believe me I request all MTech in chemical engineering students please try this… 1 saal Mai samaj aa jaega… On the other Hand old IITs BTech in Chemical Engineering students get jobs in non core domain as from starting they know that it's hard for them also to get core jobs with less PKG. But most of them goes as Data Analyst or other managerial jobs.

Right from the beginning, both have had a cordial relationship. Singapore considered itself to be surrounded by multiple threats after independence. The first and foremost was the one coming from the People's Republic of China communist government which was a serious threat to the democratic and liberal values that Singapore wanted to follow. With cold war intensifying, the threat became real. The other threat for Singapore came from the two neighbouring countries I.e. Malaysia and Indonesia. Both the countries witnessed the spread of Islam and Singapore was afraid of being pressed between the two Islamic neighbours. To balance all this Singapore had joined NATO. But it also needed a strong regional partner for which it walked towards India. Ever since India opened up its economy in 1991, it was competing against Singapore to become a favourite country for investment in the South Asian region. In the next decade, we have to acknowledge that Singapore raced ahead of us due to various factor including more free economy, less corruption and stable government. But after moving ahead when India announced its look east policy Singapore became the gateway for India to the east. Both the countries signed Comprehensive Economic partnership as well as a strategic partnership agreement during 2000–2005. Since then cooperation between the two countries has only grown to the next level. Singapore is now the highest FDI generating destination for India as well as 5th largest trading partner. Beyond economy, Singapore and India conduct an annual naval exercise ‘SIMBEX’ whose importance lies in the fact of strategic location of Singapore near the strait of Malacca considered to be the chicken's neck of Chinese economy and is the declared area of interest for Indian Navy. This year an army exercise was also conducted. This also clearly indicates the growing cooperation between the two countries which will resonate in the 21st century based on liberal democratic values along with the economic and military cooperation.

A topic like ‘Should gender neutral pronouns be used’ is argumentative and must have rhetorical language to prove your point in a convincing way. ‘What was the effect of demonetisation’ is an analytical essay and it is wise to really analyse the consequences of demonetisation rather than attacking it and its proponents. Each type of essay must be written according to the nature of the topic. Restrict your essays to 300–350 words, as beyond a point, quality matters more than quantity. The essay must be coherent and well thought out. Have a structure- introduction, body and conclusion. For this I suggest following a 5–22–3 setup. Choose and outline the essay for five minutes, execute it in 20–22 minutes, check and correct in the time left. Every paragraph should ideally deal with one or two related concepts and any paragraph written must serve a purpose. Be cool. Keep track of time. Think before you use the pen. Generally, try to have a captivating intro and a decisive conclusion. Use connecting words to make it flow. Do not make silly or vitriolic statements. Do not digress excessively. Do not bring any new ideas in the last paragraph. Restrain from including irrelevant information even if it is impressive. Unless you are habituated to it, avoid unnecessarily using complicated words. Having said that, do learn a few useful words and idioms that can help you effectively make your point. Mind your spelling and grammar. There is no need to be perfect but do not make blunders. Handwriting isn't a serious concern, but it should be reasonably legible. Command Carefully choose the topic, do not rush. Make sure that you have adequate insight and background knowledge on that topic. Recommendations Editorials, appropriate blogs, magazines. I personally do not think op-eds will help you with the essay as they are leisurely and personal while the essay is usually written with more rigour and pace. Do read long articles, but do not forget that your essay is better short than long. Speaking of the standards, it is nowhere near the level of editorials but is definitely above regular school essays. ",0.9678,Positive,5,0.0,0,5

While the odds are rare, bio luminescence may also be sighted in estuaries and brackish waters where sea water intrusion happens. It is more common in Japan, California in the US and in South American coasts. It is rarely sighted in our coasts, perhaps due to the tidal amplitude. Tidal amplitude disturbs the concentration. For the glow to be visible, there should be a very high concentration, with millions of the particular plankton species coming together. This happens in relatively calm waters.

At first, I thought of giving a straight “No”, but then I read your comment. You are a very courageous person to put up details about your health conditions on a public forum. Let me start by telling that I am no expert in giving career advice to people. Heck, I sometimes feel very confused myself about what I want for myself. The first thing I would like to tell you that don’t even think about ending your life again. Screw society, don’t even think that what others would think. Life is too precious. Don’t give a damn about what anyone else thinks about your choices. I have not been to the Counselling service of IIT Madras, but as far as I know, It sucks. I won’t give any more advice about your health, a better-qualified Psychiatrist/ Counsellor can help you with that. Never shy away from seeking help. All of us make decisions and they have consequences, in your case you are going to make a decision that will affect your career. You and only you can make the final call about your career. I understand that most classes in IIT are extremely boring and Lab-sessions are outdated. I also understand that most corporate jobs are monotonous, I have worked for 2.5 years. So yes, you probably won’t enjoy doing the corporate job. In my case, I like Physics and doing research gives me a sense of fulfillment which I was not able to find during undergrad in Mechanical Engineering. Apart from that, I have a great Mentor who also happens to be a very nice person and scientist. On a lighter note, I am not multi-talented like you, I really suck in sports :), especially in Music, the best I can do is to bang my table :). I have no choice but to eat books :( My first suggestion is that you complete your graduation while simultaneously pursuing your interests. You have done it before, and you can do it again. The reason I suggest this is that there is too much uncertainty in India and having a Degree from IIT can really be helpful if things don’t work out according to your plan. Keep it as your current plan B. If nothing, use the degree as a “brand”. Don’t opt for placement if you don’t want, try starting something of your own, if possible something for creative people like you. We certainly lack original storytellers, music-makers, movie-makers in India. Try starting something that can provide a platform for creative people like you. You mentioned that you had a very good GPA, so I would assume that at some point you do have some interest in some subjects. You are so young, you have entire life in front of you, you can always do it later if you wish. My second suggestion, if you find it just impossible to continue, then drop it. There is no point in pursuing something you find absolutely worthless in your life. I did some research about the school you have mentioned, though I found it to be legit, some of the courses are affiliated with IGNOU, please do some more research if you decide to join it. Though it is recognized by UGC, it is an open University, that could create some problem later (again, the “brand” image, especially for MBA/PGDM). For UPSC, the only music-related degree, that is valid is “Master of Music”, according to their official document [1], please do go through it, if you want to keep your options open which I strongly suggest again. It is a “Sarkari” work and they have very rigid rules about degrees. What I would suggest instead is, in case you drop-out, get a Bachelors degree in any subject of your choice (which is also good for Plan B) from Mumbai University or any other good University near your home,living among your family, and pursue your Master’s degree in Music, while doing your own thing, learning from personal music tutors, during Bachelors. Don’t care about age. You have a lot of time. We all have screwed up a lot of time figuring out things anyway, even the “settled” looking people. The only problem with creative career paths is that they are too idiosyncratic, but if it is your calling, pursue it by all means. There is a very interesting book about career paths, “So good they can’t ignore you”[2] . It is not run of the mill self-help book. It is written by a very sensible person and he has put a lot of effort and research into the book. I strongly suggest giving it a shot. If you happen to be in IIT Madras, I can lend you my copy. I can only wish you the best. Life is very complex, you study bioengineering, you know it better than most of us :). We all are just trying to figure it out.

Well, just one personal visit to IIT-Madras campus and Madras-Chennai would be more than enough to attract any ambitious and creative aspirants (we did not have the luxury of web sites/portals in those years of our studies in IIT-M). Primarily, in my unprejudiced view, the super/b ambiance of the campus and Madras-Chennai per se has been doing its best to put IIT-Madras on the top of the map and also the generic social-cum-political environment of Tamil Nadu helped in attracting students/parents/visitors/teachers/researchers/corporate houses et al. Then comes the super-duper teaching faculty, well-equipped round-the clock library, self contained hostels, site-cum-location, connectivity, sports arena, swimming pool, good food, entertainment opportunities within and outside the campus, costs of living, presence of many consulates, quick mobility, combined airport-seaport-train-bus-terminals for an easy out bound travels and so on. Here comes the campus placements - the ratio of “campus-jobs per capita” used to hover around four. IIT-Madras’ collaboration with German bellwether Universities/Government added much more value to take its reputation to further heights. And its high-technological activities had a big and positive impact of its status. The annual mega festival, Mardi Gras (now, Saarang) reached all nooks and corners of India and even abroad - it has always been a big draw. Inside the campus : the week-end OAT activities to unwind, like movies, drams, music programmes etc., too added their bits to IIT-Madras. We have been seeing, when IIT grows, Madras-Chennai grows and vice versa. And the best of all these has come just a few hours (not even days) before - ** IIT-Madras is now IOE, an Institute Of Excellence ** …to catch up with any reputed Institutions, anywhere. Thus, IIT-Madras has truly helped in enhancing the reputation of Madras/Chennai phenomenally, in these years. What else do you (we) need to assert that IIT-Madras has been enhancing the reputation of Madras-Chennai to be one of the premier Cities in India. Thanks. ",0.9976,Positive,5,0.011494252873563218,0,5

IIIT is also growing each year, probably at a much faster rate than the IITs (since we are a small place and not a government institution, we can grow faster and more freely, though there are different kinds of limitations because of this). However IIIT Hyd is renowned for research at undergraduate level. Our dual degree and honors students typically end up having done good research work that ends up in some renowned conference/journal that is at tier-1 status internationally. There is a good culture of research here, because of which students have a bit more opportunity to shoot higher in terms of academics. To enable this, we also ensure that students do the basic core courses much earlier than most other institutes (I don’t know about the curriculum structure at IIT), so that by the completion of their 2nd year, they are in some level of preparation to take up research topics or related higher reading. Also the academic experience of UG is possibly quite good. There is a lot of attention from the institute towards the first year students, to make sure they are all gelling well with the institute atmosphere, to make sure they are able to handle the pressure, to make sure they have an enjoyable time here. I have heard from all the senior faculty that such focus on first year students is not there in many premier institutes, because they simply cannot handle the volume of students in such manner. The students who join here may not realize this, and may even think this is a pain in the ***, but trust me, the amount of dedicated work and coordination which happens from both the faculty and the senior-students sides for welcoming and building a relationship with the first year freshers is simply overwhelming. I am typically only a small cog in this wheel, but I know those who do the work. So what’s my final take: IIIT Hyd means focussed academics (ECE+CS) with less diversity, a streamlined approach to BTech via the first year induction programmes, and access to high quality research in the last 2 years. IIT M in my mind means a overall diversified experience with far more choices than IIIT could offer in terms of how you want to go about the BTech. I don’t know much about comparison of post-BTech opportunities, except of course, as someone pointed IITs have a far more powerful brand name. ",0.9894,Positive,5,0.022988505747126436,1,5

Introduction Avishkar Hyperloop, the student team from the Centre For Innovation (CFI) at IIT Madras, was the only Asian team to enter the final of the ""SpaceX Hyperloop Pod Competition 2019"" held in Los Angeles on July 21. Led by Suyash Singh, a second-year M.Tech student at the department of mechanical engineering, Avishkar Hyperloop is working on an indigenous design and development for building the first-ever self-propelled, completely autonomous Hyperloop Pod in India.    Description Although the competition was won by Team TUM (Technical University of Munich), who set a new speed record of 463 km per hour, Avishkar Hyperloop met Musk, who was all praise for their stupendous work. Musk proposed the idea of Hyperloop to the world in 2013. His company SpaceX organizes the Hyperloop Pod Competition every year to accelerate the development of functional prototypes and encourage student innovation. The Pod developed by the Avishkar team spanned about three meters in length and weighed around 120 kg. The first step was to select powerful motors that could provide the required traction and a source to power it. The students searched through numerous motors and controllers and a vacuum compatible battery pack, which would best suit the design and constraints. Avishkar had to perform a number of iterations and simulations, looking through every available resource that could make their Pod better, keeping in mind the timeline. Aim and purpose The team is working with a vision to develop technologies for a future mode of high-speed transportation with applications in various fields including Defence, Logistics and Aerospace Industry, among others. Speaking about the significance of this achievement, Dr. SR Chakravarthy, Faculty Advisor, Avishkar Hyperloop, and Professor, Department of Aerospace Engineering, IIT Madras, said, ""The team has taken strenuous technical efforts at every stage, and has been quite professional about executing the project. This is an important milestone for the future transportation technology in our country. "" What is Hyperloop? Hyperloop is the 5th mode of transportation, a high-speed train that travels in a near-vacuum tube. The reduced air resistance allows the capsule inside the tube to reach speeds of more than 1000 km/h. Elon Musk, Founder of SpaceX, proposed the idea of Hyperloop to the world in 2013 through whitepaper - 'Hyperloop Alpha.' His company SpaceX organizes the Hyperloop Pod Competition to accelerate the development of functional prototypes and encourage student innovation. Select teams build a subscale prototype transport vehicle to demonstrate the technical feasibility of the various aspects of the Hyperloop concept. In this global competition, the final round (testing and evaluation of the actual prototype), takes place at the SpaceX Headquarters in California, U.S. The Fastest Pod wins the Competition. Stages of the project Speaking about the competition, Suyash Singh, Student Team Head, Avishkar Hyperloop, said, ""The primary factor to decide the winner is the top speed achieved by the Hyperloop Pod in the run in the 1-mile long vacuum tube, installed at the SpaceX headquarters. But, to qualify to the top few teams to be allowed to run through the tube, the design has to go through a lot of checks and scrutiny based on its feasibility, manufacturing possibility and its safety aspects."" What is so special about the Pod? The Pod developed by Avishkaar Team spans about three meters in length and weighs around 120 kgs. The electric propulsion employs BLDC motors and a wheel drive. The team started the design by brainstorming on how the pod would be built, beginning with vehicle kinematics and dynamics, motors, power system, and braking, stability, and finally designing the CFRP chassis and structures. The first step was to select powerful motors that could provide the required traction and a source to power it. The students searched through numerous motors and controllers and a vacuum compatible battery pack, which would best suit the design and constraints. And simultaneously came the challenge of analyzing every change in the other subsystems so that it could accommodate the change in speed, mass, forces, etc. Avishkaar had to perform a number of iterations and simulations, looking through every available resource that could make their Pod better, keeping in mind the timeline.

I remember one person who joined a tech services company (he used to do vibrations and acoustics). These were not my students. A woman PhD student from IIT Kanpur (not my student) got a job with St Gobain in Chennai. So industrial positions exist. You have to be competent, practical, and good at interviews, I think. Usually, placements don’t occur with companies that come to campus. You have to interact with an extended network and be patient and proactive. Sometimes it is possible to work for the defense labs or CSIR, but hirings are not on some regular calendar, and sometimes you may have to join on a short-term project as a postdoc or research staff member, and have some faith and patience. You could try joining smaller consulting companies if you are a go-getter and can address a variety of practical problems. You could become an independent consultant yourself in some specific technical area, like instrumentation, measurements, vibrations, failure diagnostics, NDE, … but that route is a bit more challenging. You could also try these independent routes as a part time consultant while you are a faculty member in one of the IITs and probably also NITs (you have to check their rules; I do not know). You could take a postdoc in some country like Canada or Australia, and then develop a more industrial profile there over a period of time. ",0.9561,Positive,5,0.011494252873563218,0,5

In anyway, you could apply for IT/Banking/Finance/Marketing/Consultancy jobs in case you are not interested to go in for MS/PhD.Once you are in the campus, there is no disparity among students in terms of their department, so obviously you will get to interact with people who think better than you.

It is finally you who will be in college taking up your course. What I have told here is only about IIT Madras meta, because I only have knowledge about it and not that of BITS Hyderabad.

It's infrastructure is better than other campuses. BITS administration has taken great care to ensure that all campuses are equivalent. ECE course was first to be introduced in Hyderabad campus (out of other BITS campuses). Electronics Department, thus, has decent infrastructure and facilities. So, completely on you and your nature. In case of no specific interest, I feel you should go for BITS Hyderabad ECE, purely because of big future scope in Communication. BITS is also a decent college to pursue it from. If you are interested in Material Science, don't think twice and go for IITM. Cheers, ",0.9951,Positive,5,0.05747126436781609,1,5

Textile) in order to make a safe future.Preparation for further programs: The most important being UPSC preparation. IIT Delhi is situated in a area where you can have access to India's leading UPSC coachings within few kms of radius, and trust me when it comes to UPSC, you cannot beat the level of Delhi coachings (similar to JEE coachings in Kota ). For other exams too (like GMAT, MBA, GRE, GATE) you have ample opportunities to prepare for them at IITD with ease.Academics: By far, from reviews of my seniors and some experienced teachers, from academic point of view IIT Kanpur stands at first position (strictly focussed), followed by a tie between IITB and IITD, and then comes IITM, so IITD is again a better choice.Crowd: From toppers point of view, the preference goes like: IITB>IITD>IITM=IITK, so you can expect a better crowd and sharper minds at IITD to interact with.Rest, it all depends on your personal opinions, IITM is no way behind, it is a great college to learn and succeed, but when it comes to a comparison, IITD wins over IITM. ✌️ ",0.969,Positive,5,0.05747126436781609,1,5

The campus of all these institutes are equally vibrant with very well developed culture.you mostly live on campus with friends; thus peer groups will be more or less equivalent in all three institutes.

Make sure that you can maintain high level of focus and motivation during these four years. Do everything you can to ensure a conducive environment to maintain focus. A lot of students lose motivation for a multitude of reasons and one of the main reasons I saw was the difference in culture or the distance from home etc. You might be from say Gaziabad and if you end up at IIT Madras, there is some chance that you feel very much out of place because it is far from home and culture is very different. If you chose IIT D, then there is a better chance of finding likeminded people keeping the culture in mind. For a lot of people, it is of high importance to have a society where you can relate to. You can stay focussed and do well. I can also attest to the fact that many from Delhi and north India did extremely well at IIT M so I am not saying that not all north Indians face a culture shock at IIT M. In fact, many from south India lacked motivation at IIT M for various other reasons and did not do well. Whatever is the reason, keep in mind that it will be extremely competitive and you really need to stay focussed and motivated to do well in that kind of an environment. Make the right choice based on that criteria.

Despite me being in IIT G, I think it would be unfair of me if I try classifying IITG in the league of them in cases of academic rigour.

Despite me being in IIT G, I think it would be unfair of me if I try classifying IITG in the league of them in cases of academic rigour. Because these IITs are more than 50 years old and have great alumini network, IITG has comparatively less due to its age being only near to 30. However still, it continues to rank 7 amongst all engineering colleges in India and has easily beaten even 100 year old institutes like BHU. It has given tough competition to IIT Roorkee and experts match both of them nearly in the same league. It speaks of the growth IIT Guwahati has seen. International internship:Many students get international internships each year. The number might not be as high as in IITD or IITB, but if you’re a decent candidate you can easily get international internships if you apply. IIT Guwahati has memorandums signed with many universities around the world, and there are many university that offer free internships to students with a minimum CPI criterion. Things get easier when you’re a girl candidate. I remember, in my senior batch, many girls got international internships. Gender bias will always be there, but there is nothing you can do about it. 2. Quality of companies visiting the Campus Almost all companies you would find in IITD, IITK or IITB visit IITG also. You can check the Institute’s website and compare. Prime companies like Google, Goldman Sachs, Tower Research, Microsoft, Adobe, Samsung, Facebook, Flipkart etc. visit the campus and offer lurcative packages. This year, 4 students got above 1 crore packages from the CSE department as international offers. Many students get great domestic packages too. When it comes to CSE, MNC and ECE department; almost all people get placed on the first day itself. Also if you’re in a lower branch but with a good profile in coding, it is very likely that you will land up in a good job. I remember one of my seniors told me that a guy from BioTech department, ended up with a domestic package of 35 lakhs/annum due to his fabulous coding experience.I don’t have much idea about placements in Core Sector as I haven’t checked the statistics, I’ll ask one of my friends to answer it. 3. Research funding: It is where IITG lags behind a bit. Research funding requires a great alumini network and great tie-ups with other institutes. IITD, IITB, IITM, IITK, IITKGP have tremendous amount of research funding available. IITG doesn’t upto that level, but it varies strictly. Many professors are good enough to promote you for research and can recommend your project at a higher level. There is one great thing about 7 old IITs, that there will never be lack of funding for you if you come up with a great idea. Technical clubs at IITG receive funding like crazy. Professors are research-oriented and you can pursue research under any professor whose course structure and background you like. 4. Oppurtunities and student life: This is where, IITG doesn’t lag behind and even beats some of them. IIT Guwahati has the most beautiful college campus in India. No campus can beat us in terms of beauty. Added to the benefit is that each student (except girls) get single rooms right from the first year itself. Coming onto student life, it is amazing. We have end number of cultural clubs here which are pretty active. The Dramatics Club and Dance Clubs are the most active ones. Anchorenza and Debating Society come second in the league in terms of activeness. You say an extra-curricular activity and we have a club for you. This is the best part about being in one of the old 7 IITs. We regularly participate and compete with colleges around India. A large number of Technical clubs are also available. From robotics to finance and then consulting and analytics to Coding, we’ve everything you aspire for. Two fests happen each year: Alcheringa and Techniche. Tech niche is the technical fest and comes up with amazing workshops. Colleges from around India showcase their talent here. Alcheringa is much more bigger. It comes second all over India after Mood Indigo, when it comes to participation of people and the crowd coming in. Added to the flavor of great Pro-Nites is the chance for you to participate in any cultural activity you feel like. Another perk of joining IIT Guwahati is that at frequent times, you can plan your visit to amazing tourist places in the North-East. Students from IIT-Guwahati regularly plan their trips to Meghalaya, Bhutan, Sikkim, Darjeeling, Kazhiranga etc. These places are one of the most beautiful treks and places to visit in India and an institute like IITG in the North-East gives us this beautiful incentive of visiting these places along with our college friends. I doubt, there are so many tourist destinations near any other IIT than are near IITG. Out of campus, Guwahati city is pretty safe. It might not be as much lurcative as Delhi or Bombay, but it has everything you aspire for. BBQ? We have it. Good cinema halls? We have it. Want to hang around a bar? Guwahati has it. Locals are pretty cooperative. Another point is that IITG is situated near a small village Amingaon. So if you’ve any small needs, you can just cycle around and get your necessary stuff done. Festivals are amazing. Celebrating festivals with college friends is an amazing experience. Diwali and Holi are going to be two of your best festivals at IITG. Come, and have a visit. You will fall in love with this place. With three lakes and a lush green campus, IITG offers you what no other IIT offers: natural beauty. People joining IITG this year should have no doubts about campus life. You’re not going to regret it anyway. ",0.9997,Positive,5,0.14942528735632185,1,5

I generally refrain from playing the role of a career guru on Quora, but shall make an exception on this one. I am pleasantly surprised by the OP (probably a teenager), who has asked this question solely based on what he/she enjoys exploring, though there remains another factor that shall not be named in the spirit of academic sanctity. Nowadays, it has become quite rare for Indian students to make choices depending upon what give them satisfaction and happiness. Now, let us jump back to the original query. In view of the OP ’s love for physics, I believe ME or EE should be the choice. Please note that I am ignoring his/her prior exposure to coding, for coding has as much to do with computer science as bicycle repairing has to do with mechanical, or changing light bulb has to do with electrical engineering. If you are interested, you can easily pick up programming skills on your own, irrespective of your formal domain of study. As a matter of fact, all the engineering streams have sub-specialties specifically dealing with scientific computing. Mechanical engineers explore stuff like computational fluid dynamics, computational solid mechanics, etc., whereas electrical engineers play with computational electromagnetics, control system, device simulations, and computational network analysis. It must be pointed out that serious work in these domains requires much more than simple coding. One needs to cultivate a deep understanding of the underlying physics and mathematics, along with specific skillset in numerical modeling and analysis. For persons interested in both programming and physics, such engineering domains offer excellent opportunities to test and hone their knowledge at the forefront of technology. Having appreciated the relevance of computing in core engineering domains, it is worthwhile to note the differences between EE and ME, in terms of how much physics they include. Both EE and ME (or most of the other streams of engineering) are essentially applied physics. ME is effectively derived from classical mechanics and thermodynamics. In contrast, EE is more diversified as it involves electromagnetics (antenna and wave propagation, circuit theory, etc.), a bit of classical mechanics (electrical machines), and quantum mechanics (semiconductor devices). Therefore, at least at the undergrad level, EE may appear to be more maths-heavy than ME. Moreover, EE also involves some applications of discrete maths (graph theory and Boolean algebra). However, at a more advanced level, ME borrows from physics topics like non-linear dynamics, and the (tear-jerking) tensor calculus involved in solid mechanics. So, in a nutshell, both EE and ME have the scopes of keeping you in close proximity of physics. However, many students often fail to realize and appreciate that what they are studying is actually applied physics and mathematics. To put it simply with reference to high-school physics, if your inclination is towards mechanics and thermodynamics, go for mechanical engineering. If you have taste buds for electrostatics, electricity and magnetism, etc., electrical engineering is your thing. And don’t worry about your interest in coding; once you commence your pet project of writing a simple finite element solver for a supercomputer, you will start appreciating the kind of programming real men do. ༼ つ ◕_◕ ༽つ ",0.9989,Positive,5,0.1724137931034483,1,5

There are various theories about how we ended up with the name ‘Madras’. The most agreed theory is that it acquired its name from ‘Madrasapattinam’, a fishing village which was situated to the north of St. George fort. Other common theories are: 1) When the Portuguese arrived at the village in the 16th century, they named it Madre de Deus which was later came to be known as ‘Madras’. 2) The village itself is named after an Islamic college ‘A Madrasa’ , situated in the same area leading to the name ‘Madras’. Apart from the theories, historians believe that it is named after a prominent Madeiros family who declared the Madre de Deus as a sacred church in Santhome in 1575(This church demolished in the year 1997). On the other hand ‘Chennai' is said to have got its name from Chennapatnam, which is believed to have situated towards the south of the Fort, which was named by the Nayak of Wandiwash, Damarla Venkatadri Nayakudu, in the memory of his father Damarla Chennappa Nayakudu, who was the governor during the reign of the last Raja of Chandragiri, Sri Ranga Raya VI, of the Vijayanagara Empire. There are various other theories. This too is another common theory. Another explanation is that, The site chosen by the East India Company included two small villages—Madrasapattinam ( North of St. George fort ) and Chennapatnam (south of St. George fort). After the construction of the fort almost in-between them, the 2 villages began to be virtually considered as one. As time passed by, the confusion over Madrasapattinam and Chennapatnam increased to such extent that the exact location of the 2 villages were lost forever. While the British preferred to stick with Madrasapattinam and eventually Madras, the local people chose to go by the name of Chennapatnam, which had a Dravidian connection and is believed to have originated from the Telugu word for beautiful, i.e., Chennu. Even after gaining independence in 1947, it wasn't until 1996 that the state government officially renamed Madras to Chennai. Although there are so many theories, no one knows exactly why or how the names came into use. ",0.9028,Positive,5,0.034482758620689655,1,5

Yes - Because I was from IIT, I got good a career break into IT (which was rather having a boom around 1999–2000 period) and have progressed well in my life so far. Things which I learned in IIT in general during my MS tenure are helping me till date. So that way I am quite satisfied and at times really enjoying my life. Only due to this career I got chances like staying in USA, Germany, Austria and so on and have created a good track record for myself. So I am forever grateful to the fact that I did my MS (Aerodynamics) from IIT-Madras. There are personal/family reasons why I ended up with IT instead of continuing with Aerodynamics Research - not going into that here. No - Because MS is a research course and the amount of work I had to do kind of burnt me out. Also, I didn’t get to do the kind of research I loved because the institute back then had other priority projects for which possibly they had funding or maybe the professors really liked those topics rather than what I wanted. I always wanted to work on Automotive Aerodynamics and that too mainly using experimental stuff (rather than purely computer simulation). I did get a chance to work extensively using resources like Wind Tunnel, variety of measuring probes and scale models and all that - but that was related to aerodynamics of buildings instead of automobiles. Unfortunately, that kind of research is valuable only outside India. If I had got to work on car aerodynamics, then who knows! I might have got a chance to work on automotive stuff in India which I would have really loved or there was a remote chance of even working with some racing teams abroad in MotoGP/Formula 1 or lower rung racing engineering teams. While I am loving my current IT work, I would have definitely loved working hands on as an aero-dynamicist with auto makers or racing teams. ",0.9951,Positive,5,0.0,0,5

But, when I did my M.S, my thesis went to two experts, one in India and the other abroad. Generally, after the evaluation of the thesis, there will be viva -voce in the department of the IIT with the external experts. But, in my case viva -voce was waived, and my thesis was approved culminating in the award of the degree. On enquiry, a veteran professor told me that if you get both the reports as outstanding from both the reviewers, viva -voce would be waived. In any case, the degree was awarded by the IIT, MADRAS and this had helped me to get a Phd admission in the IISc, Bangalore, which by any yard-stick was not easy. Any higher degree acquired during working would add to your weight. However, you incur the wrath of serious displeasure from your colleagues, simply because they could not do it, and you did it. Some people even stopped talking to me after I got my PhD degree. This world is filled with jealousy. You should ignore all such things and move ahead. This is what I normally do. I just move unruffled. I have an abundant faith in the God. I just move undaunted. I advise others also to do the same.

In my first project at Dell EMC, I was working with the team that developed the Android and Portal solutions for the screening and management of NCDs for the Ministry of Health & Family Welfare, Government of India under the flagship program of the Government of India - 'Ayushman Bharat'. During my time on the project, I found out about other similar healthcare initiatives where technology was an enabler in addressing the structural issues pertinent to healthcare. If executed successfully, there are tangible benefits behind incorporating IT & Analytics in the healthcare space. Therefore, I believe Healthcare-IT as an industry is only going to grow in the future. So, coming back to the point of IIT-Madras collaborating with THSTI on applying advanced analytical approaches for predicting pregnancy outcomes and childhood mortality is good news. In India, though the Maternal and Child Health indicators have improved over the years, we still have a long way to go in this space. Although various state governments have a technology solution for their Maternal Health programs, and they capture data in bulk through these applications; what they fail at is generating clinical insights from these systems. This data thus means nothing! It's just loads of information with no insights for the policymakers. However, now through this collaboration of data scientist, biologists, physician-scientist and engineers, the team will use analytical techniques to predict pregnancy outcomes, childhood morbidity and mortality, the role of nutrition on pregnancy outcomes and childhood mortality and morbidity. They will also undertake capacity building exercises for students and young researchers in either space. If successful, the critical insights gathered from this collaboration will go a long way in addressing the issues and problems related to Maternal & Child Health related issues.

The admissions are largely based on your scores in GRE and number of seats available in the course. Usually, the matter of specialization comes up after joining IIT and then with the consent of respective teacher-Professor to take you under. If you just want to audit a course in VLSI, in many IITs the student have to submit a document named COT (Consent Of Teacher) so that you can be a ‘passive’ student in VLSI classes and need not give an exam. The student only must decide about it. Interview of a potential student who applies for an M Tech course in IIT is a process adherence and a formality to go through while primarily his/her GRE score does score over in the admission. So, prepare well on your Grad course fundas, get ready and do not bother too much about the interview - do take the question if it is shot at you and answer gently or ask for another question, if required to handle. In IIT, M Tech is known as M Tech by examination while M S is known as M S by research. Whereas in case of M S by Research, the area of research comes up even before engaging in an IIT. Here too, the quality of your synopsis on the research subject (here, VLSI) is considered pretty important to in the selection by the concerned Professor who can guide you there. For such programmes like M S and Ph D in IIT, the interview stage is rather very crucial and critical indeed. God bless you. ",0.984,Positive,5,0.09195402298850575,1,5

852,852,Indian-Institute-of-Technology-Madras-IITM,What hardships you faced in your journey to acing Joint Entrance Exam (JEE)?,9,1,9/1,Yes,Followed,2019-02-01,https://www.quora.com/What-hardships-you-faced-in-your-journey-to-acing-Joint-Entrance-Exam-JEE-1,"Thanks for the request, but the first thing I would like to say is that I didn’t ace it to any extent! (AIR 3000+) There are various stages from which you can start your JEE prep. I started after my 10th boards, so I can only offer that perspective. First, if you haven’t had tuitions before or have always been a class topper effortlessly till Class 10, starting JEE coaching is an humbling experience. It depends on how you take to being reduced to one in the crowd all of a sudden. It requires a mature mind to take it positively. You can expect some tears at the beginning, as if everything is suddenly falling apart. As long as you keep at it, though, improvements do start to show. Support from parents and teachers is especially important in the beginning. I also went to school along with coaching, so let me talk about that as well. First off, I do recommend not going to school during JEE prep, since it does waste a whole lot of time (if your school is average like mine was, in case you have an elite school which already offers JEE coaching to the bright kids, by all means, go to school!). Everyone around you gets into the coaching mode, bringing their modules to school as if it were a show and tell. What you have to do is not look beyond yourself. Just attending a coaching means nothing. What matters is hard work. (Catching up on this later in my answer) In the beginning, you will also be compelled to buy books suggested by coachings. I can’t specifically guide you to any since my rank wasn’t that great that I can claim my material will guide you to the top, but I will advise you to get the previous years questions (I think it’s almost 40–41 years now) subject wise, of JEE Mains and Advanced, from a good publisher e.g. Arihant. For the first couple of months, you will be thinking school or coaching, which do I focus on? I honestly have very little memory of these traumatic times. I just remember somehow doing both. Till date, I have a recurring dream about how I aced the latest mock test of JEE Mains but I have the English boards the next day and I have prepared nothing. I never used social media as I grew up, except Whatsapp (only started FB two days before I joined IITD, that too just to join the fresher groups). It is probably best to cut down on it. Time management is automatically learnt as long as you have the determination to improve. You will see, the day you get up extra motivated, you plan out stuff for yourself to do throughout the day. If you can’t get anything else from JEE Prep, do learn to wake up to a plan everyday. This is the main reason why IITians generally achieve anything they put their minds to, they are already used to it from JEE prep, and overwork means nothing to them. Doubts. You will have doubts, lots of them. See if you are doubting an entire concept or only a particular type of question. Usually, a doubt asked to a teacher is only valuable if the student has grasped the concept properly on his/her own. I will talk about my ‘doubts’ now. I was very bad at mechanics, since the beginning of 9th class. But school being school, never exposed my weakness. But JEE coaching did. I flushed red in the face when a mechanics problem was in front of me. No matter how much effort I put in, I couldn’t ever say I knew it. I wasted 5 months of Class 11 on it. Later after 11th, I used my entire vacations to relearn the entirety of mechanics before 12th started. I realized how little I knew. Relearning the basics from my teacher helped my confidence a lot. I still didn’t like it, but at least I wasn’t completely lost. Another problem you face is doing work that isn’t needed. You may be very good at a particular topic, say complex numbers, but your coaching modules will always have that one question which you cannot solve. This really undermines one’s confidence, but one shouldn’t get too involved. I used to feel bad and read my notes again, when in fact it wasn’t necessary. It was probably a trick question, that needed specific information, or some other issue not related to knowledge of the fundamentals. What I’m trying to say is, don’t be scared if you find a question you can’t do. Just do what you can. Know that it isn’t necessary to prepare every topic that’s appearing in the coaching tests, unlike school exams. Your concepts will rescue you in the tests. It doesn’t need mugging up. Try to learn from your exams. JEE is mostly about speed and accuracy. My personal method was to keep going from question to question till I found something I could solve. I solved all those I could do and then went back to the beginning, solving the ones I needed a second look at, and so on. For example, in a mock JEE Mains paper, I would solve about 15–20 questions going from questions 1 to 90, solving what I could instantly. The mind automatically keeps working on the unsolved questions in the mean time. In the next round of solving, I would solve another 25–30 questions. By this time, it is usually clear what you will still be able to solve from what is left and what you cannot. And I would have about half the time left in the exam as well, so I would spend 1 hour solving questions I thought I could solve and the last half hour just reviewing/revising that I had bubbled properly, etc. Slowly but surely, time passes and you get used to the grind. Your motivation also increases as the time to the exam decreases and you start feeling like you can do it. You will start noticing that once the basics are taught to you, you can solve problem sets for days on end. That’s where learning begins and coaching ends. It’s important that the aspirant sees their role in putting their coaching to use. Now let us move forward a bit to class 12th. All of a sudden, those classmates started dropping out of their fancy coachings! They lost their motivation, and fell into the trap of getting intimidated by JEE. This is exactly why I said the preparation requires a mature mind. It requires great courage (at the age of 15–16 at least) to keep trying even when you don’t understand something. And that is why topping class 10th means nothing. Many toppers are unable to carry on if they aren’t toppers any more, they get their hearts broken and decide JEE is not for them. Anyway, the main problem in 12th for me was the time of the boards. I knew a lot of time would be lost in Feb-March for the boards, so I stopped going to school altogether after the first semester. I solved the problem sets again and again to crystallize my concepts. Then the boards came and went, (with their own set of frustrations) and there was Mains a week after that. The stress that I felt during Mock tests was very different from the very real fear I felt while attempting JEE Mains. This is why I hate the toxic system. There’s so much hype built up around JEE that every moment is thought of as a life or death situation. Luckily, I found my natural rush back within half an hour and was able to secure <1600 AIR, even though I messed up a few easy questions. The time between Mains and Advanced is one of the most frustrating periods, because one often starts thinking things like what else could I possibly do, after having solved everything in front of me. I would advise you get some good problem sets to keep yourself busy, mind not to pick up extremely hard ones. Do not expose yourself to new material just one or two weeks before the exam. Do not focus on weak concepts, focus on strong concepts and make sure you will be able to solve anything related to them that the paper throws at you. Consult your coaching profs, but mostly spend time with yourself in this period. There isn’t much the coaching can help you with now. Get used to solving for 6 hours without a break. The exam centre won’t have an AC, so solve for 9–10 hours everyday so that on the D-Day you can handle the added pressure without much physical strain. The day before advanced, I did absolutely nothing. The hardest part was going to sleep on that day. I remember there was the SRH vs KKR match going on, and after watching it I wanted to peacefully sleep. But I couldn’t. I was shivering in fear throughout the night, and I slept pretty badly. It was okay though, and I did well enough in Advanced to justify my hard work. Now, you will think, my job is done. But no. The saddest part is looking at your results afterwards and realizing it’s not good enough for something you wanted. In fact you realize that even if your rank was 1000 better, it would still not be good enough for what you wanted. Then all the questions about CS/Not CS, IIT/not IIT, and whatnot, it just breaks your heart wide open, especially after all the hard work you have put in for the last two years. This was absolutely the most heart-wrenching phase of my life, ironically it has nothing to do with JEE Advanced at all. ",0.9986,Positive,5,0.10344827586206896,1,5

The paper setting committee consists of professors from several IITs. You don’t have to prepare anything specifically for JEE Advanced conducted by IIT-Madras (PS: It’s IIT-Roorkee for 2019). Coming to preparation part, you have almost 4 months after JEE Main (January) to prepare well for JEE Advanced. This will allow you to stay calm and make an effective strategy to crack JEE Advanced in remaining months. Identify your weak topics in JEE Main exam. Read them again and work on things which gave your trouble in the exam whether it’s speed or time management. Cracking JEE Advanced requires in-depth knowledge of subjects. Just remembering the formulas won’t help. The basic requirement is that you should know, understand and feel what’s going on in the topic.In last 3–4 months before JEE Advanced, the two key areas to focus on are revision and mock tests. You can prepare a revision time table and do revision in short intervals. Revise all your learned topics and problems.Solve JEE advanced previous years papers – chapter-wise tests and full test paper. Solving chapter wise will help you judge your weak points in each topic and will help you fix them faster. Solve some papers in the same exam like pattern. This will make you confident about your time management skills.Make a list of common mistakes you are doing while solving previous year questions. Just go through your mistakes again and again until you are sure you have fixed it and won’t repeat it on the exam day.Observing the recent pattern of JEE Advanced, the thing that should must be taken care of is Accuracy. In JEE Advanced, accuracy matters much more than your speed. Since even a slight mistake can ruin other question’s marks.On the exam day, pick up the questions based on your strengths. Since you have some time left, you have time to look into your weak spots too, but don’t neglect your strengths as these will be crucial in fetching a good rank.JEE Advanced will test your exam temperament (6 hours, with 2 hour break between paper-1 and paper-2). Keep solving JEE Advanced online mock tests, as many as possible.All the best for JEE Advanced. ",0.9822,Positive,5,0.22988505747126436,1,5

Let me deduce it step by step. I am an IIT Madras student lived for four damn years so i am worth to explain it. Reasons: 85% attendance-Pyscho Profs- They dont teach stuff but give assignments that student could not complete. Poor Medical and Counseling Facilities- Even u have motions u get dolo 650. Pyscho HoD’s Dark Truth(ragging and politics) 1: This happened and was posted anonymously it some facebook page for political reasons. Institute Elections are full of Politics. Students from telugu states do lot of politics. The X General Seceratary of IIT Madras and Y Speaker of IIT Madras once beat up a junior Sai Uxxxj and kept him and his friend in a dark room for hours. Some how they got help and called SLC guy. This SLC guy was tamilian and immediately came to help rushed to the hostel room they were locked up ,called Dean . Dean took the students to his home and were counseled. And what happened to gen sec and speaker , nothing!, no action was taken against them as it ruins the institute name. They desperately wanted to be the best enginnering college with graduating gen sec and speaker having no ethics. Very Proud of it. Dark Truth(Attendance)2: If APJ Abdul Kalam gives a lecture would any one miss? no right!. I agree that attending classes is important but so high 85%. If u miss just 1 class above the bar then done ,u have repeat the entire course. The number should be reduced students should be given exception based on reasons. Dark Truth(Pyscho HoD)3: CSE, ELEC, Mech shine with internships and placements but what about other branches. Let me give u a view of civil internship and placement stats. The civil hod wanted his students to only do civil internship and get placed in civil company. No of civil companies called for interns : 4 No of students required to be placed:100 No of companies called by HoD:0 No of civil companies called for Placements : 4 No of students required to be placed:100 No of companies called by HoD:0 Each company only takes 1 or 2 btech so roughly 8 gets intern or placed and Hod wants students to do civil intern Dark Truth(Course Allocation)4: Here courses are not allocated based on what students are interested in but according a software called SEAT which uses cg to categorize. Ultimately most of the students end up doing useless courses. Once up on a time there were minors which were very useful but now they r removed. Dark Truth(Saathi and Mitr)5: Saathi is a student body for counseling students in depression when ever some suicide happens immediately we see saathi and mitr posters hanged around hostel zones and no one cares just after 1 week. Saathi Core is just a position of responsibility to become gen sec . it is just treated as a political advantage to upgrade to a new position. Saathi and Mitr are dead orgs. If u see the linkedin page of iit madras or dean of acads u can see posts like “so student from mech had done blah blah..”.

A non-vegetarian, according to the prevalent tradition of South India, is not someone like a carnivore. They take vegetarian food, along with fish or meat as a side dish. The best way to solve the problem is to have separate vegetarian and non-vegetarian messes. A vegetarian mess would contain staff, who are vegetarians. From what I have read about the controversy, it is not practical for the management to implement the scheme. The next best scheme would be to have two kitchens and two eating areas in the canteen. This, again, amounts to having two separate canteens and therefore not practical. Then, a solution may be arrived at by considering the issue of cooking vessels and utensils. Unless these are made of terracotta, it is possible to clean them to a sterilised condition, without additional expenditure. (Terracotta vessels are ideal for turning milk into curd. Now, scholars can think if milk is a vegetarian or non-vegetarian item). So, let me suggest to use glazed ceramic utensils for cooking and serving vegetarian food and aluminium and stainless steel vessels for these purposes for vegetarian food. Original ceramic wares, called China, are expensive. But today, inexpensive, ceramic coated iron vessels of equally good glazing are available in the local markets. Now comes another problem. People, especially students, like to eat together with friends. So, let there be another section in the kitchen and dining area marked as Vegetarian cum Non-vegetarian area. I fail to understand the problem with washbasin taps. Indians usually eat with their right hand. While washing the hand, all of us use the dry left hand to open and close the tap. I have additional information to present. But, that will be based on the comments that I may get on this answer. I am a non-vegetarian. But I eat some types of fish and mutton or beef very rarely.

It hosts about 3500 students, which is in no way a small number. I should mention that I'm a vegetarian. I wouldn't agree with separate basin or entrances to a mess based on eating patterns. It's unjustified, and absolutely doesn't prepare you for the future. I don't agree with different plates either, but can understand the concept for the sake of security. The argumemt in support is that a vegetarian person doesn't want to eat in a plate in which a nonvegetarian person had a meal. Fair argument, but it does nothing to justify separate entrances and basins. Separate eating areas are not justified by this, as seating on nearby tables doesn't transmit nonvegetarian - ism. Seating vegetarians and nonvegetarians in separate corners accomplishes nothing. It's not like nonvegetarians come and force you to eat nonveg if you are within 2 feet of them. Coming to the plates, I'd say they are washed after meal and then, you'll use them, so it does not matter what the person ate in it earlier. An opponent would argue that there is no guarantee how well it was cleaned, and so why take chances. My rebuttal is there is no surety that both the meals aren't cooked by the same person in the canteen. Even if they aren't, there is a significant possibility of some mixing in the canteen. If you choose to trust them there, why not trust here as well. I understand not everybody buys this, so yeah, I'm open to having separate plates, even though I, personally, find it unnecessary. As for the consequences, what happens when you get a job and you're having a lunch in your cubicle and Mr. Sharma in the nearby cubicle is having chicken. Do you go and ask him to have his lunch some other place? Do you ask the firm to have separate washrooms for vegetarians and nonvegetarians? How do you ask your manager to move you to another cubicle because the guy near you eats chicken? Wouldn't he ask if Mr. Sharma forced you to eat his chicken. How do you think he'll react when you say, “No, no. It's just that he eats chicken, you know.” Let me just mention that I don't think they're practicing untouchability, just stupidity. The untouchability angle is making a small issue too large. I think the best way is to do nothing. Let students eat wherever they want, with whoever they want. Just ensure that nobody is forced into anything. Have clear counters for veg and nonveg items so that people don't partake in nonveg items by mistake. Also, wash the damn plates properly, and everything will be alright. ",-0.9564,Negative,1,0.05747126436781609,1,1

I understand that vigilance is necessary to keep a check on drugs and other items but this could be checked at the entry of gates itself. Instead of paying to vigilance every month or disturbing students they can solve through other means.
