If they realize what they have in their hands they can change the world around.  The major difference lies in the reason of establishment itself that eventually lead to huge difference in both the institutions and their approach towards different things. IITs were established to provide finest technical manpower for building the nation. IISc was established by private bodies to conduct core research with focus on advancing the scientific capabilities of the country. Therefore these institutes provide Knowledge according to their fundamentals.You see hell lot of IITians in companies running there with a shiny life style and if you get a chance to go to IISc you feel the calm and focus without much shiny life style and a commitment to research and scientific advancements.IITs have several thousand students studying different streams of engineering to equip themselves to set in industry where as IISc have few students working towards high end research and get into research industries in the nation.Faculty Have a look onto any department faculty list in IISc and IITs, you would be amazed to see people who with noble laureates and few were nominated for noble prize too still love their lab and work in IISc. Popularity IISC is as popular as the IITs, in the academic circles. It is just not that much in the spotlight in media as the IITs. The number of IITs is 23, and there is only one IISC. So even if one IIT comes in news every day, the IITs automatically grab more spotlight. UG courses offered by IISC: 4-yr Bachelor of Science (Research Program) in Biology, Chemistry, Earth & Environmental Sciences, Materials, Mathematics, Physics. UG courses offered by IIT Delhi: 4-yr B.Tech program in Chemical Engineering, Civil Engineering, Computer Science & Engineering, Electrical EngineeringElectrical Engineering (Power), Engineering Physics, Mechanical Engineering, Production and Industrial Engineering, Textile Technology. Placements from IITs are well known in number and quality; Placements in the IISc are as good but they usually in higher positions in the firms as IISC produce the brainstorming research individuals. IIT pass outs go on to doing MBA degrees at IIM or top universities abroad. Some of them become entrepreneurs or top execs. IISc, being a postgraduate institution, produces candidates who then go on to become professors, researchers or Scientist. Hope it will help, thanks ",0.9838,Positive,5,0.2826086956521739,1,5

Academics - One of the best among ALL IITs, we have Fractal Academics, periodic tests, and branch exclusive courses since beginning of engineering. Most students are academically strong due to this system. Our syllabus is much better than the ‚Äúold‚Äù IITs with outdated syllabus. A lot of positive Japanese influence on internships and placements. Sports - One good gym, which can be called just enough. A 5/10 football ground. A 6/10 basketball court in the temporary campus. A 7/10 lawn tennis ground. Otherwise, no good play fields/courts/etc. nothing. I would rate it 3/10 for outdoor sports. For indoor sports, it is quite good - we have Snooker Tables, Indian and American Pool Tables, Foosball Tables, Carom Boards, Dart Boards, Chess Boards etc. 9/10 for sure. Infrastructure - One fully functional academic block for now, state-of-the-art. Another one which is about to be fully functional by July-August‚Äô18. Hostels are just too good, as compared to any IIT - German architechture, all single rooms, cooling systems for the summers, washing machines, 120 mbps LAN cables in every room etc. But because the entire site is under construction, there is nothing much other than hostels and acad blocks that we can boast of. (Half of the area looks like a construction site, which it actually is, sadly.) Clubs- Only 3‚Äì4 clubs do actual work. Rest of the clubs don‚Äôt do what I would call some solid work. (I would say quite a lot of the clubs are outlets for seniors to try on the junior gals.) Professors - My brother has been to one of the old IITs, and I can swear on my life that on an average, the professors here are 10x better than what my brother got. (He passed out of IIT in 2017) Culture - In general, a very encouraging culture for working. Great environment, every body helps you. The general culture is quite good because of the low campus strength, you get chances easily wherever you want to put a hand in. No strict rules at all - no stupid entry/exit timings for hostels. About 2‚Äì3 DJ Nights/other recreational events every semester. Tinkerer‚Äôs Lab - Amazing, funded lab to create anything you want to. One of the best things a productive person can get. Ever. Fest - A very few people really care, disoriented and stupid, to say the least. Big names involved none the less, Kailash Kher, Benny Dayal and other great stars have been here. Going to the main city takes about an hour, and people generally go on refreshment outings to Hyderabad on weekends. Hyderabad is equally incredible for foodies and techies.

Though my own goal was not so high (I wanted a seat at IIT Bombay, no branch preferences), most of what I learnt and applied and ultimately scored with the help of in my Mains and Advanced was during a year after almost wasting my entire 11th. With your aim, you‚Äôll need to put in much more though. You might be aware that as you‚Äôll need to aim for an around top-50 rank to be sure of a seat at IIT Bombay CSE. It‚Äôs an extremely huge task, considering that thousands of students aiming for those ranks in 2021 have been preparing extensively since the past year and some even from before that through foundation courses. But do remember, to get to the top and compete with them and ultimately be one of the top rankers, all that matters is whether on the exam day you have been able to reach that level. You‚Äôll definitely have to put in way more hours than most serious aspirants do and sacrifice much more than them. So, if you are able to attain that level of command through intensive studies, rigorous tests and a continually upward trend in your mock test ranks, you can reach there. It doesn‚Äôt matter where you are this month; what matters is where you reach after a year of practice. And if you are able to do whatever it takes, it‚Äôll just seem like an exam you need to ace exceptionally well - the ranks and the seats will all fall into place.

It was not but today when I decided to go for a walk while it was drizzling and came back enchanted.  You get world class sports facilities here including football, hockey and cricket grounds, indoor and outdoor courts for tennis, badminton, squash, volleyball and basketball. Not to forget the high-speed Internet at your room.   The speed increased!!! ^  ^This is where your lectures are held. Who wouldn't want to be at this place? And then there are cultural and technical clubs. These are the places where you make memories and friendships that last. Interact with seniors and juniors and together come up with amazing stuff! You decorate your department for festivals and have intra-department championship competitions with faculty as a team too!     And at the end of the day you go to your hostel (there are 12 at IIT Guwahati) and spend some time with your lobby mates you usually are your class mates as well and develop the feeling of a family. Have a hostel spirit, get crazy and try to prove your hostel is the best during Manthan (inter hostel championship). you get to go for late night stroll after exams‚Ä¶  And the placements are 10 folds better than other universities and colleges.

The curriculum provides broad based knowledge and simultaneously builds a temper for the life long process of learning and exploring. ‚ÄúIIT Delhi is the dream of every science student. You get to live what actually is the ideal college life. You are totally independent there. The hostel life, academics, co-curricular, extra-curricular, events, fests, and everything just make it an amazing place to spend 4 years of your life.‚Äù Campus Insights The campus is mainly divided into three zones: the Academic area, the Girls‚Äô hostel and faculty residence area and the Boys‚Äô hostel area. There is one main building in the academic area that is linked to all the blocks and lecture theatres. A new MS is also on the verge of completion of construction. The CSE people have got a fully AC Bharti School for themselves but now as the Khosla building is ready, CS department is hoped to shift there. And not to forget, Textile, being the oldest department, boasts of an entire building devoted to textile engineering.  Faculty Top-notch faculty members, a rich list of eminent alumni, Guest Faculty and International Faculty, IIT Delhi has it all. Being one of the highest ranking institutes in India, IIT Delhi offers a plethora of opportunities to interact and learn from professors involved in various fields of academics that not only widens your perspective but knowledge base as well. Cultural Activities The Board for Recreational and Cultural Activities(BRCA) is an amalgam of all the cultural clubs of IITD including Debating, Quizzing, Literary, Dance, Drama and Fine Arts. All these activities are carried out very enthusiastically at IITD and BRCA is definitely doing its role to keep it so. Also, it is the BRCA that organizes Rendezvous, the annual cultural festival. Rendezvous is the largest college festival of north India with thousands of students coming from numerous colleges in and around Delhi for the extravaganza. And honestly, rendezvous does live up to all the hype that surrounds it! BRCA events have a rich history of inter-hostel competition but since 2013-14, all events have become non-competitive. Nevertheless the enthusiasm is still there.  There is a separate Board for Student Publications, BSP that prints regular magazines and newsletters. BSP also organizes Literati, a literary fest, in September. BSW BSW, i.e. the Board of Students Welfare, is a board of elected students that have the responsibility of representing students before the administration and put forward students‚Äô needs. Also BSW assigns a mentor( a 3rd yearite) to each student. She/he is to guide you in academic as well as non-academic matters throughout the first year. BSW organizes a fun festival, Esperanza in September. Also there is zero tolerance towards ragging at IITD and you can directly approach your mentor for help. Sports Facility  Facilities include, a cricket field with four turf wickets, four flood-lit cricket practice pitches, flood-lit hockey and football grounds, three flood-lit volleyball and two basketball courts, eight flood-lit tennis courts (four synthetic and four clay courts), tennis practice wall, two squash courts, one badminton hall, two table tennis halls with synthetic flooring, one weight-lifting hall, Olympic size swimming pool, kid‚Äôs pool, two multi-gyms, a flood-lit stadium with 400 meters athletics track, flood-lit jogging track and ancillary arrangements for all the games. Residential Life The ambiance of student life and activities on the campus is to provide an invigorating and creative environment which promotes independent thinking and introspection and leads the young students to become more aware of the consequence of their own actions. The campus also offers amenities like Staff Clubs, Hospital, Shopping Centre, Banks, Post Office, Telecom Centre, Community Centre, Stadium, Playing Fields, etc. There are eleven boys‚Äô hostels and two girls‚Äô hostels.  You must have heard from seniors that IIT rooms are like prison holes and all that. Well, to be honest, your rooms are not going to be very comfortable. Unless you are lucky enough to have been allotted Udaigiri or Girnar hostel, you have to deal with cobwebs and ‚Äòmicroscopic‚Äô room size. The mess food is almost completely edible. But these things won‚Äôt matter much once you get along and believe me in a matter of months, you would start loving your room. Also remember that the best way to enjoy your hostel life is to take part in as many activities as you can with your friends. Places to hang out In Campus Cafeteria: Cafeteria is right in front of the MS. The food here is cheap and makes for a good quick meal. It‚Äôs a nice place for having on hot samosas.Caf√© Coffee Day: CCD is adjacent to the iconic Wind T (it‚Äôs an area under the MS architecturally designed to facilitate air flow through it). Wind T is the hub of activities, always abuzz with club groups, friend circles and couples. Also the CCD at Wind T has a nice ambience.Night Messes: Majority of IIT-Dians are nocturnal creatures. And night messes at various hostels are there to cater to the students till 3 or maybe 4 in the morning. While Jwalamukhi is famed for nice Chinese, Satpura offers authentic roti-sabzi and Udaigiri boasts of the best Maggi at IIT.Students‚Äô Activity Centre(SAC): As the name suggests, SAC is the centre for a plethora of activities like indoor sports and gym as well as BRCA events. A new swimming pool is being constructed at SAC.Outside Campus: SDA Market: Just opposite the Main Gate, SDA is the favorite hangout place for IIT - Dians. Good cafes and snacks outlets surely help to serve the taste buds.Ber Sarai: Ber Sarai is the nearest place to go for buying books for both IIT and JNU students. Its chaat and momo stalls are very popular.Hauz Khas Village: Hauz Khas Village has a beautiful lake and historical architecture. HKV boasts of the some of the finest cafes and clubs of Delhi. Perhaps the best place for a romantic date.Connought Place: It‚Äôs a favorite destination for foodies and shopaholics all over Delhi.PVR Priya: Munch on a McDonald‚Äôs burger and watch a nice movie at this Saket theatre.Hope it will help, thanks..

Here people don't shy away when you ask them ""do u masturbate?""and someone will say ""ya, three times a week.""and the big thing is that it is perfectly normal .377 is a common number here because of the delhi high court order.

Founded by IIT Kharagpur graduates, Kaustubh Khare and Saahil Parekh, Khetify is a startup promoting food sustainability to city dwellers. Claiming that 16,000 sq km of rooftop space is being wasted in urban cities, Khetify aims to promote use of this unutilized space to develop small rooftop farms. If as a country we can turn just 10% of this into farms, we can produce fresh nutritious vegetables for around 200 million people,"" estimates Khare, 26. Explaining the startup's motto 'Desh Ka Culture, Agriculture' Khare said, ""We believe that urban India has been disconnected with farms, farmers, and their agrarian roots. Unless cities take control of their food systems, true sustainability could not be achieved"". Khetify develops compost-based modular 'khets' (farms) on vacant rooftops and enables individual households to grow 700 kgs of organic vegetables every year in as small a space as 200 sq ft. Understanding that scarcity of time is as big a constraint on city dwellers as is lack of space, Khetify uses IoT (Internet of Things) enabled drip irrigation system which can be controlled remotely and also helps in conserving water. In nine months of its operations, Khetify claims to have transformed over 7,000 sq ft of vacant roofs and balconies in Delhi-NCR into small urban farms which has produced over 2,200 kgs of vegetables of 55 different varieties. Chosen as one of the finalists in the AIM Smart City Accelerator Program (developed jointly by Ashoka University, Microsoft Ventures, and DLabs at the Indian School of Business), Khetify found support from plenty of sponsors. ""They are bridging the gap between the produce in the rural country to the consumers in urban areas. There are just too many steps involved in this process which eventually results in price escalation and crazy margins which are not even percolated down to the farmers. The team is readily available and employ farmers as part of their network,"" says Holostik Group, group director, Ankit Gupta. Holostik Group is one of the principal corporate supporting the accelerator program. A team of six, Khetify employs two farmers who execute the function of maintenance for the clients. The startup is now looking to grow its customer base by approaching schools, housing societies, universities, among others as well as expand its crop portfolio. The target is to make 50 schools and 150 households achieve food security by the end of 2017. This would mean the startup needs to employ an additional 10-15 farmers. However, hiring high quality talent from the domains of agriculture, botany and ecology has been a challenge. ""First of all, there are a very low number of students who take botany as their subject and even those who do, do not want to work in the industry. As for farmers, they also prefer working in factories over choosing farming as a source of livelihood,"" shares Khare. Another challenge has been the easy procurement of compost, cow dung and other materials essential to farming. ""Chemicals and fertilisers have so pervaded the system that it is extremely difficult to source natural, chemical-free compost. We spoke to several farmers and had to give them detailed instructions to get the right quality. This is going to be a challenge as we scale up,"" says Khare. The statup has tuned its back-end operations interface with the informal economy such as daily wage labour, logistics and transport along with dealers of compost, cow dung and bringing standardisation to these has been a challenge. Khetify charges a one-time fee for the installation of the 'khets', depending on the size of the 'khets' and a maintenance charge for the supply of high quality seeds, saplings, organic fertilisers, pesticides, herbicides among others. Claiming to have achieved a positive unit economics, the startup generates enough revenue to support its operations and has also received an undisclosed amount of seed funding as part of the AIM Smart City Accelerator Program. ""As part of the program, the startups are encouraged to solve problems with liberal arts perspective. The program advocates government's focus on developing smart cities and Khetify intends to make agriculture a vital part of smart cities,"" says Ashoka University, director, Priyank Narayan. Disappointed that the narrative of sustainable cities is grabbed almost exclusively by renewable energy, Khare wants Indian cities to realise the importance of food security. ""If a city can produce as much as possible, as close to where it is consumed using as much renewable energy as possible, it is sustainable. This logic is applied selectively to electricity and fuel (solar, wind, biogas etc) which is the energy that powers a city. We want to apply the same logic to the energy that powers citizens, which is food. Khetify hopes to make cities more sustainable and give its citizens access to nutritious, organically grown food that citizens can trust and trace,"" says Khare.

Two Start ups with diametrically opposite products and business models, yet amazing in their own ways. 1.1. Ola: We always complain that there is no Indian brand which is truly global. Probably Ola is going to become the first true global brand from India. The way Ola has given a stiff competition to Uber despite Uber's pumping up huge money to Indian market, is admirable. Lately Ola is easing ahead Uber and leading the race. Some pictures of this: 1.Ola launched Green auto in England  2. Ola is making big in Electric vehicles: Recently it has generated 400 crores of eatly phase investment from Hyundai and making all plans to go ahead of other competitors. Ratan Tata raises stake in Ola, invests in fledgling electric vehicle business 3. Ola recently rejected an offer from softbank of around 4000 crores for 10 percent equity. That's another thing that Bhavish Agarwal does not want a similar fate like Flipkart. But look at his audacity!! Rejectjng a 4000 crores offer for 10 percent equity!! He has a bigger vision for OLA. MAY BE TO BECOME THE NEXT HENRY FORD OF TRANSPORTATION SECTOR. 1.2. The Viral Fever (TVF) This is not a YouTube channel merely, but an entertainment start up with net worth more than 400 crores. So do not compare it with Amit Bhadana or BB ka vines next just because they have a larger YouTube subscription.  This entertainment start up has given some amazing products like:    Have you pondered few things: How does TVF generate revenues for such high budgeting productions like Tripling, Permanent season 2 etc?Why an IITian choose to launch an entertainment start up which is not his domain?Points to think: Are not these two start ups are class apart? These two start ups sells two diametrically opposite things, yet they both do it wonderfully. Indian start ups are doing it big. Kudos to the founders who took earnest efforts to achieve their dreams. End note: By the way Kota Factory has doubled TVF's valuations. https://www.livemint.com/companies/news/tvf-aims-for-turnaround-with-fresh-tiger-funding-1558523721207.html ",0.9959,Positive,5,0.7608695652173914,1,5

I think every pure science student must have a dream like this. ‚ÄúOne day I will become a student of the most popular IIT‚Äôs which are one of the best institutions in India (as well as in abroad!). And then, I can say proudly to my neighbors or relatives that ‚ÄòI am IITian‚Äô.‚Äù Yes, you guess correctly. I had also a dream like this. I am not interested in engineering. So the only way I can enter into IIT is through JAM ( if you neglect M.tech and Ph.D.). So I tried to clear JAM and successfully I did. By the way, after the admission process was over, in one fine morning I came IIT Kharagpur. I got a room in Lal Bahadur Shastri Hall of Residence (LBS) with two partners (of course not life partner). A new journey starts! Frankly speaking, I am one who came from a village where the literacy rate is not good. When I said, I study in IIT, usually, people in our village think that it is ITI. ‚Äú Ooo ma, tai! Aamar chhele ei to ager bochor ITI te vorti holo. Kharagpur gele keno ? Ekhane chance hoyni?‚Äù (Oh, really! My son also took admission in ITI in the previous year. Why did you go kharagpur? Didn‚Äôt you get a chance to admit here in our local ITI?‚Äù. This funny thing happens not only with me, I guess. Everyday you have to wake up early if you want to attend the class at 8 am. Then take breakfast as fast as possible and start cycling to go Nalanda Classroom Complex (which is 2.2 km away from my hostel). At 1 pm, go to your hostel, have lunch and quick bath and then again go to the main academic building ( 1 km from my hostel) for lab class. This routine continues from Monday to Friday if you are a very serious student!! Here academic pressure is so high that even you can‚Äôt copy the assignments in time!! If you study regularly ( which is possible theoretically !) then it is fine. Since you are not a serious student ( like me) then you can‚Äôt imagine how fast mid-sem will start and end. After one or two weeks you can really feel, ‚Äúwhat the hell IIT is!‚Äù. If you are not ready for the pressure then your CGPA will not also be ready for you. Apart from all the pressures, assignments, class tests, exams there are several things which can bring happiness in your mind. You have to just find out the ways. IIT Kgp campus is extremely large and very beautiful. If you love cycling then KGP is the best option for you. Especially if you try to cycling at night with some of your friends, you will never forget those experiences. If you love sports, then ‚Äú Jnan Ghosh‚Äù and ‚ÄúTata‚Äù are always ready to serve you. Not only these two, but your hostel playgrounds are also there. There are grand Gymkhana and swimming pool as well. If you have a girlfriend/boyfriend you can enjoy in the park without any tension whether it is day or night. In every Friday, we go to ‚ÄúNetaji auditorium‚Äù to watch movies. Whole week‚Äôs frustration will vanish within just two hours. Except for exam time we never miss that. Another best thing is the ‚Äúillumination‚Äù in Diwali. If you are not KGPian then you will never understand the ‚Äúillumination‚Äù. It is an emotion for all students. Instead, I will show you some pictures.    Another important entertainment is Hall Day celebration. Every hostel has a particular celebration date. At that time everyone is allowed in the hostel. You can invite your sir, girlfriend/boyfriend, friend to your hostel on this particular date. You can even dance with a DJ. In the end, I want to mention one more thing, Dc++, KGP‚Äôs own creation. Unlimited storage of videos along with software and PDFs. If you know what I mean by ‚Äúvideos‚Äù!! How I can complete my answer without mentioning the most important thing!! IIT Kharagpur SPRING FEST ! which is one of the largest college fests in India. You never forget this 3-day entertainment which is held every year in January. The countless event, prizes, music, rock, dance, DJ night - so many things are there. You will get a lot of refreshment at this time. Have a look at the pictures( credit goes to Facebook).    Overall life at IITKGP is extremely good except academic pressure. You have to explore the campus. You don‚Äôt need to be a serious student all the time!! All the best for all the people who are thinking to come here. You are always welcome. P.S.- If I forget to write any important things please mention, I will edit my answer.

They only look at how long you‚Äôve worked, what is your skillset, and what you can offer them so that their profit is maximised and they earn as much money as possible.

Placements are really-really good, I can not emphasize more on this. Best of Luck for Your Journey. Thanks Karan Kumar Rajput ",0.9888,Positive,5,0.15217391304347827,1,5

As far as joining the ISRO, I guess there is reserved quota for B.Tech. students from IIST for jobs in ISRO (depending on your academic performance), so they have a slight edge over IITB guys. However, I have seen ISRO coming for placements at IITB as well. They recruit students from the Electrical and Mechanical department as their requirement for aerospace engineers is fulfilled from IIST. Also, if not through college, ISRO conducts the exam every year for recruiting scientist and engineers. So in a nutshell, your chances of joining ISRO depends on the preparation for the ISRO exam and interview (assuming you are not persuing bachelor's from IIST). As long you fulfil their requirement criteria, B.Tech. in aerospace engineering from IITB or anywhere else should not matter much. P.S. : Above answer is related explicitly to joining ISRO.

Like the director himself has said ‚ÄúWe must bring a closure to the current semester to help our students.‚Äù ‚ÄúThe next semester will be run purely in the online mode so that there is no compromise on the safety and well being of the students.‚Äù IITs are for students and students are the priority, their health and their safety is something which is of uttermost importance to them. I remember the licence of the mess facility at hostel 10 was immediately being cancelled as soon as some students were affected with food poisoning. The decisions they take might sound cruel, but it is always for the betterment of their existing and upcoming students. If you are wondering that not everybody can afford or has the equipment for the online lectures and that too for a whole semester then don't worry, here are the words of the director: ‚ÄúA large section of our students come from economically less privileged families and would require a helping hand to equip them with the IT hardware (i.e. laptops and broadband connectivity ) to take these online classes. We look forward to your overwhelming support to help these bright young minds to continue their learning without any further hindrances or delays. We do not want a single student to miss out the learning experience for the lack of money. We have estimated that we need about Rs 5 crores to help those needy students. Our alumni have committed a good amount of support, but that is not enough for all these needy students and I solicit through this message your donations, however small it may be. I am sure that these beneficiaries of your philanthropy will in future contribute significantly to the growth of our Nation.‚Äù The only challenge I feel for them and for the students will be the conduction and grading of the exams, but that too could be solved by adapting following measures: Taking LIVE Viva on Video ConferenceTaking LIVE Presentation of their projects through Video ConferenceAssignments (that anyway was homework)Another measure I feel is by conducting an online quiz (MCQ) through say Google Forms. (If you are thinking that how we can avoid copying? Honestly, only the IITians know that in the exams we were allowed to carry a cheat sheet (formula sheet) on which we basically used to scribble everything (probably copying the whole book) with tiniest of handwriting when anyway it never proved to be useful.) Here is a snippet from my farewell poem:Kya yaad hai tujhe?Exams ke woh dinRaat raat bhar padhkeBhool chuke the neend Formula sheet ke naampePuri kitaab likh denaJab ki pata tha humeGhanta farak nahi padna So you see, even these hurdles could be solved.

113,113,Indian-Institute-of-Technology-Bombay-IITB,Why did you choose IITB over other MBA colleges after scoring high in the CAT?,2,1,2/1,No,Followed,2020-06-25,/Why-did-you-choose-IITB-over-other-MBA-colleges-after-scoring-high-in-the-CAT,"Why I Choose SJMSOM, IIT Bombay over other IIM's:(Note: This is going to be a long post) Following are the reasons to choose SJMSOM, IIT Bombay for an MBA program. (Note: These are my reasons to choose SJMSOM and others view can differ) 1.Placements: We all have to agree that most of the students who pursue an MBA want good placements in reputed companies and SJMSOM placement record has been phenomenal in recent years. Average placement of SJMSOM is around 21 Lakhs. 2. Small Batch Size: SJMSOM, IIT Bombay has a batch size of 110 students (now the batch size has increased to 152). So I feel having a small batch size has an advantage as we get to network well with others in our batch. I can say that I know everyone personally from our batch. 3. ROI: SJMSOM has one of the best ROI in the country. Our course fee is around ten lakhs for two years, and an average placement of the batch is around 21 lakhs. 4. Ranking: SJMSOM, IIT Bombay is one of the leading B-schools in India. NIRF ranking of IIT Bombay is 11. And this was also one of the points I considered before choosing any college. 5. Location: I feel location matters, and as IIT Bombay is located in the financial capital of the country (i.e. Mumbai), it definitely has the location advantage as compared to other colleges in the country. (Many people may disagree on this point) 6. Networking: Networking is one of the essential factors in any MBA graduate life. And SJMSOM has a rich alumni base spread across a variety of industries. The icing on the cake is that we not only get to interact with SJMSOM alumni but also IIT Bombay alumni which I feel is really beneficial. 7. Interaction with others: If you are at IIT Bombay, you interact with not only SJMSOM students but also students from B.Tech, M.Tech, PhD. , Design, etc. and therefore you get the hang of diverse field which helps you a lot, also you make a lot of friends from diverse fields. Don't miss the fact that you also get to interact with the brightest mind of the country. 8. Entrepreneurship: If you feel you have a million-dollar idea and you want to open a company, then IIT Bombay is the right place. We have SINE(Society for Innovation and Entrepreneurship), ecell, eclub(SJMSOM) who helps you to build your start-ups and also helps in finding and meeting with the potential investors. 9. Campus life and Infrastructure: People say that ""Mumbai is the city that never sleeps"" and this phrase goes with IIT Bombay too. You will see students doing different activities throughout the day. With a lush green campus of over 500 acres, you can never complain about the campus life of IIT Bombay. Lake, hills, gym, Olympic size swimming pool, sports ground, cafes, restaurants, auditoriums, yoga rooms, indoor sports facilities, seminar rooms, technology centers - you name it, and we have it. Moreover, you also get to organize Mood Indigo(India's largest cultural fest), TechFest and E-Summit. Coming to the other part of the question of choosing IIT, Bombay after getting high percentile, I would like to say that getting high percentile does not guarantee you a seat in the top IIMs. Every MBA colleges in India has different criteria for selection which includes past academic records, diversity factor(gender as well as academic), extracurricular activities, work experience, etc. And we should also remember that CAT is just an exam to filter out good students, and your selection depends upon a lot of other factors(mentioned above). Lastly, I would like to say that rejections should not dishearten us and I always believe that I cannot change my past, nobody can, because it is not in our hand, but we should work hard for our future to be good. Here are some of the pics of my 1-year stay at IIT Bombay: Campus view from my room  Met with one of my favorite comedian. Kumar Varun  Avenues( SJMSOM Fest)  Also worked as the coordinator of India‚Äôs largest Cultural fest Mood Indigo.

I was angry as well because of the unfair fees structure. Then I came to know how much the government spends on each IIT student. It spends on us much more than what we pay. Additionally, there are schemes to help students - both economically backward and/or from the reserved category. As a result of this, I have seen all kinds of students here - the ones from the sprawling metropolises of Mumbai and Delhi, who are unafraid to show off their parent's money, as well as ones from distant, unheard of villages from remote corners of Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh, unable to form a complete sentence in English. However, all these hardly matter once you enter the classroom and take your seat. From that point onwards, the only thing that matters is how fast you can solve a complicated differential equation. Well, not just differential equations, but you get the point. The professors don't discriminate either - most of them are from humble backgrounds and have worked really hard to get here, so they understand the struggle. Recently, I read a post by the director of IIT Bombay, where he has declared that the institute will provide internet access and laptops for the upcoming online semester to all economically backward students, and has asked for donations for the same.

We should not take into account the coronavirus pandemic and its effects since its highly possible that the paper had already been set way before we knew that all the exams were going to be delayed.

The only reason why IITs have Entrepreneurship cells is so that students of IITs can commercialise an idea or product that they made while studying in the college. However, Continue ReadingFirst of all, I think people want to join IITs for all the wrong reasons. I don‚Äôt know why but people associate IITs with high paying packages, places where startups happen etc. IITs are Indian Insititute of Technology and not a college for startups and someplace you come to specifically earn money. IITs train you to become engineers and not startup founders. You are much better off taking commerce, then getting an MBA degree. The only reason why IITs have Entrepreneurship cells is so that students of IITs can commercialise an idea or product that they made while studying in the college. However, it is not IITs prime concern. Stanford, on the other hand, provides MBA degrees and Engineering/Science degrees. Also, in my opinion, the only reason why IITs are so highly regarded in the world is due to the fact that there is no bias. Admission is strictly based on JEE scores. It is really tough to crack JEE that means those entering IITs are one of the best students in the Engineering field. But beyond that, IITs are just average institutions with basic facilities. Yes, the labs are great, but there is little you are allowed to do in the labs as a BTech student. Most of the students get 95% of their knowledge from online courses and not actual classroom studies. So changing the pattern of admission will just ruin the whole impression of IITs. The reason why IITs are popular in the first place. Stanford/other Ivy leagues are famous for the fact that they are genuinely one of the best colleges in the world. However, it is not ensured that only the best students get in there. Pay huge amounts of money and even a dumb person can enter that college. Perform well at sports and you might make it into the sports quota. Have ‚Äúpassion‚Äù with no ground knowledge and still get in. Also, the American and Indian social-economic landscape is very different. Children over there start earning money from very early ages. Teenagers 15‚Äì16 years of age do part-time jobs/freelance work and make enough money to buy their own smartphones/computers/games/snacks etc. They work as waiters in restaurants, employees in McDonald's etc. Which is considered ‚Äúsmall‚Äù work in India? However, in places where the economic situation is much better than India, their jobs are taken up by students/teenagers. They learn valuable skills like customer/consumer management, ‚Äúselling‚Äù a product etc. How much money have you earned till now? When you know how money works, you can truly develop a passion for your startup. Most kids in India live in a protective cocoon of their parent‚Äôs income till the age of 21‚Äì22 only after that they seek jobs. They have never ‚Äúearned‚Äù money, they have never ‚Äúsold‚Äù a product. They don‚Äôt know how consumers behave towards your business. Studying in an IIT and helping out startups by fellow IITians and helping out in the annual social fest that every IIT conducts (For which students have to get their own funding) I know a bit about the business myself. We had to call sponsors, advertise to potential customers, bring in partners and convince potential investors. So I can tell you most ‚Äúpassionate‚Äù students have never seen the reality of business. When they do they just give up. Students in US have already experienced all of this already in school. Therefore, their passion can be verified. If you really had ‚Äúpassion‚Äù you do not need IITs or Stanford. People start businesses in school itself. Name brand universities just help you out a bit. So stop trying to change the system. The system is there in place after many decades of trial and error and learning. Many successful startups have come from IITs and from Stanford. They did actually give up their passion (only for 2 years) in 11th/12th so that they could get better exposure in IITs. Being in India, I cannot say your ‚Äúpassion‚Äù will last long. I am pretty sure 99% of students like you will just give up after seeing the reality. My question for you is if you really had a passion for your startup, can you not study well for 2 years. Crack JEE and avail all the help and support you can get as a student in India? Can you not do this small thing? It's not as if you will be able to create some million dollar startup in high school itself (if you can why do you need IITs/StanfordüòÄ?).

Let me tell you, Some students study the whole day in one sit than also they cannot crack JEE mains and Advanced and some people study only 10 to 12 hours a day efficiently and crack JEE mains and Advanced with high percentiles. The difference in studying between both types of students is that the student who studies the whole day does not give his/her full concentration. They indulge in distractions and the student who studies 10 to 12 hours a day gives his/her full concentration and does a smart study. I am not saying the one who studies fewer scores more. The point here is full efficiency, no distractions, and smart study. Its only 6 months left with you. In these 6 months, you have to give your 100%. Do smart study and don't mess up. Clear the main topics first and start other topics. Solve as much as questions you can solve. Practice as much as you can. At last, I will recommend you study in breaks. Don't sit for more than 3 hours and multiply these 3 hours slots from 4, that means 3 + 3 + 3 + 3. In the middle, you can take 1.5 hours break and can take naps. Don't indulge in gadgets and study effectively. ",0.9812,Positive,5,0.043478260869565216,1,5

Well obviously you can prepare for IIT JEE in one year from zero level!! Since you have not mentioned which one year are you talking about in this question. Is it 12th year or drop year? So I am going to tell about both so which one is suited for you can help you. First of all if you are in 12th then then you have 7.5 months before JEE main January and after that 3 months time for JEE main April and after that 2 months for JEE advanced. Since if you are in 12th then you will certainly have to give boards which will consume approximately 2 months between January and April. And in remaining one month you won't have time to learn new concepts and revise them too enough times. Also the 2 months time for advanced also cannot be used to learn new concepts as they will be in your mind on superficial level as compared to old concepts and will not come in handy in exam. Further these activities can reduce time to strengthen previously learned concepts which would come handy in advance. So if they are also weak your score may further decrease so this period is also to be kept for revising concept. So all together you have to complete your syllabus in 7.5 months i.e by December any how. To do this you can use summer vacations and winter vacation and other vacation for studying the syllabus of 11th and rest of the time for 12th. Now considering you are in your drop year then you will have a bit of relaxation because you have already given your boards and have fundamental knowledge of class 11th and 12th which would too help in your preparation. Your knowledge of fundamentals would avoid your hard work to learn basics as you have already done it. Plus you have no boards so you ha 2 months extra time after jee main January which can be used to learn new concepts and then you can certainly bang April mains and advance. Now the question arises how to prepare? You can use a number of books like HC Verma for physics is more than enough. Solving it 2‚Äì3 times can easily get you through physics paper even in advance. If you want to go for tougher problems go for IE Irodove or FIITJEE study material. You can also go for Resnick hallide walker to strengthen your concepts but I would not prefer that as it's too bulky and would consume your time. Even HC Verma can clear concepts same as Walker. For maths either you can solve cengage or you can go for fiitjee study material. I would prefer fiitjee study material. It's awesome it has a great variety of good questions. Plus it is not bulk like cengage. In cengage 1000 questions per chapters is given but in fiitjee study material 200 questions per chapter. For chemistry by heart NCERT for mains read it as many times as you can. You can use GRB Himanshu Pandey for organic questions and GRB Kapil Kumar Wadhwa for inorganic chemistry questions. For physical chemistry I would prefer FIITJEE study material but you can also go for RC Mukherjee but let me tell you that it is a bulky book and you might feel irritated to solve it. PS :- I am not promoting fiitjee study material in any kind. It is just that I find it more helpful as compared to other coaching materials. Finally don't forget to solve question papers one month before every exam!! Number of question paper solved ( analysis and rectifying mistakes to) is directly proportional to marks Hope you find it helpful üòäüòä ,0.9972,Positive,5,0.043478260869565216,1,5

One thing should be made very clear in your mind that about 90% of students don‚Äôt know anything about 11th or 12th when they start their preparation for this prestigious exam ,they don‚Äôt know about the strategy how they should prepare or what should be done and what not to be done so that time wastage is nil and all such things but with time and preparation coming in full swing ,they get to know about each and everything in detail and hence succeed in exam. Another thing which should be made very clear is that IIT JEE syllabus is vast ,but time is limited ,you will have the required sources but due to time limitation, PANIC MODE will be activated which is quite common but to deactivate and overcome that mode,you will have to keep CALM,you will have to keep PATIENCE and you should learn to face the world and problems ,and those who overcome these situations are first one to succeed in exam as well in their LIFE. Now coming to strategy ,I will tell you my strategy because exactly the same situation i had faced ,and with proper guidance, i was able to do well .I also had my 11th class fully drowned in FUN ,but soon i realised the importance of time and exam ,and hence started my preparations with the following strategy.Note that for me, class 11th,12th was new, i started in preparation in class 12th which was quite challenging but as told earlier ,proper guidance was provided ..So without further due ,let‚Äôs go for strategy.. I started mine preparations in APRIL with NCERT for CHEMISTRY and PHYSICS for class 11th and then class 12thas soon as one chapter was completed,i went for the questions given at the back of that chapter no thinking whether they are theory ones, easy ones or difficult ones ,likewise i completed the both NCERT‚Äôs in two monthsAfter completing the theory part, i went for the questions from the books suggested by my teachers. i also gave a brief reading to theory given in that book so that concepts would remain in mind .Solving questions with concepts was the main task and i used various tricks after i was 100% clear with concepts.With these two subjects, I also used to solve MATHS questions from the standard books ,and the one which were being taught in classes.Making NOTES while reading was one of my habit because that helped me a lot while revising things .I didn't join any test series due to unavailability of required resources .Rather my coaching provided me chapter wise tests and subject wise tests on the weekly basis and that was the only reason why i was seeing improvement in my question solving techniques.There was time when i scored 5/120 in subject wise tests and there was time when i scored 85/120 in subject wise tests.So improvement will come but with hard work and proper practice.My school had 85% attendance criteria,so most of my nights have went sleepless because during day time ,i had to attend schools and then after school ,immediately coaching ,so only time i used to get was the night time ,and once you start to study,you don‚Äôt look at time.For standard books , refer to this answer i had written previouslySaksham Dwivedi's answer to How can I get good marks in the JEE exam without any coaching classes and without any coaching material? My strategy was not at all great one but helped me to get decent rank in IIT JEE.

(Caution : Mechanical Engineers Please Don't feel bad about the truth which I am going to reveal ) Important point:- Even BTech in Mechanical Engineering department at IIT for Higher packages either go towards Machine Learning or Data Analytics‚Ä¶ They mostly used to target Companies like BCG, GS, JP Morgan Chase, Credit Suisse, HSBC, Citi Bank etc‚Ä¶ Some goes for MBA some goes for MS where they pursue MS in finance etc like streams‚Ä¶ As you all know Mechanical Engineering is not a branch which is capable of giving you higher salaries in Pvt Industries. Even Airbus and Boeing like Companies offers a package of around 10 to 12 lacs in IITs to freshies‚Ä¶ But IEOR is a very dynamic branch. In that courses related to Machine Learning and Data Analytics are taught‚Ä¶ Which are most happening fields‚Ä¶ Which are capable of paying a very hefty salaries in Companies like Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase etc‚Ä¶ But being at Machine Design or something like that is not at all worth in MTech‚Ä¶ Also I have seen BTech students in IITs in Mechanical Engineering has no where excited for the core jobs. Either they start doing coding or start doing courses related to Data Analytics‚Ä¶ As around 80% of them targets Companies like Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan, Credit Suisse, HSBC, Citi Bank‚Ä¶ etc‚Ä¶ Mostly none wants to go in low paying jobs‚Ä¶ Only those try to go in there core fields who from 1st year says ‚ÄúYrr mera toh coding Mai koi interest nahi hai‚Äù and in the end they land up Mediocre‚Ä¶ I have a story to share about which I heard from one friend‚Ä¶ It's a story of an IIT BTech from IIT Bombay Mechanical Engineering‚Ä¶. He was an extremely sharp student‚Ä¶ He got around 300 rank in IIT JEE and took admission in IIT Bombay just for the sake of name although he could have land up in Computer Science Engineering or Electrical Engineering in other good IITs. But after 4 years he regrets his decision. When he saw his batchmates bagging hefty packages who belongs to CSE and EE. Because he got placed in Mercedes Benz. Which pays you Penny's he got a CTC of 10 lacs‚Ä¶ And he regrets even more because his peers who made sensible choice by taking CS or EE in some other IITs also bagging high salaries jobs‚Ä¶ So he worked for 1.5 years around in Mercedes Benz. Than he think it's not his cup of tea. So he left the job and started preparing for UPSC but it has been his 4 attempt this year but still he is not able to do it. So you can imagine 1 wrong decision destroyed his entire confidence just because of inferiority complex. Like wise many are there in who either goes for an MBA or start to move towards the coding field. So I will suggest you to join IEOR rather than core field‚Ä¶ Because MTech end krne ke Baad fir Government Job ki tayari krte hue Nazar aaoge‚Ä¶ Bologe ki yrr Government job hi acha hai‚Ä¶ Kaam bhi Kam hai or salary thoda jyada hai‚Ä¶ Because Mechanical Pvt sector is not that good‚Ä¶ But yes if you continue to work for 5‚Äì6 years than you will be earning a decent amount in Pvt sector also in Mechanical Engineering core field. Because starting is not that good‚Ä¶ But remember your peer's will be earning even more in 5‚Äì6 years of work experience in Pvt sector who belongs to CSE and EE. Some of them might cross even crores if CTC within a time frame of 5‚Äì6 years. Hopefully You understand my view point. Regards, Singh Nikhil ",0.9986,Positive,5,0.0,0,5

Schools and colleges of such districts could be used as shelter homes for such people. It needs detailed planning and strong management by government.The reasons for relocating dharavi slum people are as below It is simply not possible to contain the spread with such huge population density of Dharavi. Even healthcare workers, if possible, may avoid going into such areas for testing.Hygiene is bad in slums as they have community toilets and bathrooms.Administration is impossible with such huge crowd. Shifting people to low density districts will considerably lower the strain on mumbai administration.Once, decongestion is done, increase the rate of testing at different places instead of just focussing on Mumbai alone. The shilfted people could be entertained by rural work in the long run. But, that could wait for now. ",0.9035,Positive,5,0.010869565217391304,0,5

The academic advantage :The study culture and research culture along with the courses in these institutes are designed in a way that you have to take the best out of yourself in order to survive the competition. It enables you to learn, think and apply your learning in an accelerated manner , which is one and the most important thing you would require for the rest of your life in order to survive in the IT industry , as we all know the technology and applications we use today will definitely be obsolete in a few years from now and we need to keep our learning skills intact to cope up with the changes.Peers : You would be learning with some of the best minds in the nation, which is a rare opportunity , it helps in your overall development of you as a person as well as keeps you down to earth as no matter how good you are , you would definitely find someone better than you, someone from whom you can learn from .Resume boost : Most certainly you would land in a handsomely paid software/ research/analytics firm from the placements itself . But even later on when you switch between organisations , having the IITB/D tag certainly helps.Disadvantages: Since the competition is huge, sometimes if your grades are not at par, you might not get to work with the prof/subject of your choice. Every professor in IIT CSE is legendary in his/her own research area but not all of them can be as good of a guide.If you already have a decent paying job , and you think you are good enough to get a salary at par with IIT graduates after 2 years of working/experience and you are not interested in research either, then maybe going for MTech might not be the best option.

I would highly recommend you to join a coaching center (with good prior results) which can guide you and prepare you for JEE. For maths and physics I would suggest practicing as much questions as you can based upon the relative importance of the topic involved. You should be fluent and confident on selecting the questions you can solve by just reading the questions. Trust me, knowing the path of how the question can be solved or is to be solved gives a huge time boost. For chemistry, well, NCERT is enough for most part, and completely solving it is a must, and only after fully solving NCERT you should try other books. Now, one of the most important step is to know you where your strength and weakness lie. This you can achieve by giving mock tests which are easily available online. Once you have figured that out, you can start either working on weakness to bring it up to the mark or just leaving that topic. One of the keys to crack JEE is to know that you don't need to solve every question or hard question, you just need to solve the easy and moderate level questions which will be more than enough in the beginning to build you confidence, and once you have finished those and still have time left in the exam, you can move forward to solve the more difficult questions. I understand this answer is vague, but you should keep in mind there is no definite path one must take to crack IIT, it all depends upon the individual's intelligence and determination. For example, if you are unable to solve basic and past year's physics questions, it is useless and demotivational to try to solve Irodove. For online material, you can refer to Brilliant | Learn to think , this website contains lots of questions which you can practice to increase your answering speed and efficiency. There are other websites also but I would suggest you to adhere to the advice given by you coaching institute as these websites might be addictive and they might waste your time.

My school friends often poke me that how a big of loser i am that i can't get any girl to talk to me. I was like very frustrated by these jokes on me and even my little brother who's in 10th starting making fun of me sarcastically. One day i decided that now without wasting any dime of my time I'm just gonna go for it. I was very nervous but i started üåü motivating me by saying that üåç earth is very minute and me and her are very üî¨ microscopic and all of that kind of enlightenment shit üòÇ. The girls in my batch have friend-zoned me and most of the second year girls already have boyfriends and many seniors were competing for them so, i had no chance but there was one girl of whom everyone used to talk of that how rude she is and everyone who has ever tried has always come empty handed. She was very focused and girls fear to give her number as she strictly told them not to go against her guidelines if they want to be friends with her. I approached her one day in our annual fest, she was looking gorgeous in her black dress and was tryna help her bestie who has just gone high in just two drinks and a half shot she shared. This picture is from her instagram account.  She asked me to help her with getting her friend hostel on time and i agreed. I did uber to the hostel and she thanked me for being such a nice guy. I wanted to take her contact number but i thought it might sound too creepy so i didn't . She waited with me for couple of minutes as i have to go to an after party with my friends and uber was late as i wished. She started the conversation by asking about me and my interests and got really friendly with me and at last i asked for her no by saying, ‚Äú I can help you in these type of future situations so can i get your number ‚Äú. She nodded with a smile ‚ò∫ and gave me her üî¢. I texted her that night üåÉ as she didn't üò¥ sleep very early due to her habit of being an owl for studies. After asking her some random questions i asked her is she single and she said, ‚Äú I'm not into dating as i don't like getting hurt like others ‚Äú. She discussed her old relation with me that how this guy promised to be with her forever and forgot her when he landed a job in japan. We kept on talking that whole night till 3 in the morning and i slept üò¥ don't know when. She met me after a week at the cafe and we also had lunch together. She discussed her ambitions with me and asked me to come at a üéä party at her bua's ( dad's sister) residence. I was very nervous as everyone was saying that see this boy is with aditi and don't you think didi they look good together. After the party she said bye and turned around but then i said aditi, she turned over and i ü§ó hugged her tightly and said it was a good party and thanks for having me. But here things started getting really messy as when i looked at her face she was trying very hard to hold her tears and was numb. She just walked very fast to her bua's home. I said in my mind, ‚Äú Lag gaye L tere aman ‚Äú. I texted her many times she never replied and went offline as soon as i texted her and she didn't come to college for some time. After some days i walked straight to her and confessed my feelings for her and she said that aman this ain't ‚ô• love, this is just mere attraction i understand your feelings and we can still be friends. I just üö∂ walked away after hearing her remarks. I focused on my semester and took a while off the internet and one day nikita came over to me and said aditi wants to talk to you something really important. I picked her phone and she her voice sounded very heavy like she has just about to burst into tears. She said that she also had strong feelings for me but wasn't healed of her past betrayal. She didn't know how to react at that moment and after that so she just did nothing. She asked me to go out with her ( A date Yes!) and from there we had so many great moments and yes we've did all those things that couples do , My family knows that she's my girlfriend and a senior too. Her mom knows about us and i hope that one day her father also agrees. It's my last year with her and in this Lockdown üîê i got to spend even more time with her on imo video chatting. I'm very serious about her making my wife very soon. I love you until my last breath aditi raghuwanshi. Love yours, gobulu ",0.9997,Positive,5,0.03260869565217391,1,5

Frankly speaking, I went down memory lane to realize how well my life has turned out to be at IITB. The only institute through out my journey, which has uplifted me through every aspect of my life, be it academics, fun-loving and what not. I am pretty sure you will get many different answers, with respect to hostel life, or relationships‚Ä¶ but I am not sure if those were the sweetest memories of mine. However, I am sure that my journey in IITB was sweet in itself. As a research scholar, most of our days are spent in the lab or library and tell you what those are the best days. I miss those days terribly in this lockdown. Our lab is like 20 students together and the fun which we have together can not be defined in any context. We will discuss our PhD problems, try to solve them together. If any funny incident happens between you and your proff is so happily shared amongst everyone. The morning greetings till the late nights wishes, we all have been together so much that now when you have to start a new life together, it just feels empty. We have a projector in our lab, so there were some months, in which we used to project a movie on lab wall late night and will watch till the next day morning. Oh the fun watching in lab as if it is your second home, I just can not describe it. 20 different people, having so different perspectives about life, coming together, staying almost 15‚Äì16 hrs together. Trust me, I have learnt a lot from them. Our Chea canteen chats every evening, ‚ÄúChea chalein?‚Äù, just to have a cup of tea and find some time from our work to chit chat, listen to everyone , have some fun. These days are being missed terribly and will be missed always. The love and respect my labmates have shown to everyone, is something that will remain with me forever. Our various road trips on long weekend, our ‚Äúdaru‚Äù parties, people dropping me to my home after late night parties (though they were the ones who were drunk, but used to drop me first :)), the care‚Ä¶.. somethings just become part of you. Through all this journey, we all always had in mind that our professor is there to keep us on track. Like you find a different Guardian in a new city apart from your parents. They will ask about our work, keep us in progress always, will sometimes listen to our frustrations too. Being in our problems, when we just could not find solutions on our own, be it personal or professional. They have been there always! Sometimes they would know that we are just having fun, and they would just let us have that! I think my sweetest memory is the journey in itself, and not a particular person or episode. But, if you still insist in narrowing down this, I will say my sweetest memory of IIT is spending time with my labmates and professors. ",0.9968,Positive,5,0.03260869565217391,1,5

It could mean two things One, that the computer science comes naturally to you and you're in your own elements when solving problems in that area. And since you're asking about life in general, here's some serious advice: don't let family hinder your career. This family includes both:the ones you already have, and the ones you'll chose for yourself. Applies even more if you're a male (question doesn't seem to specify). Two, you've worked so hard on people telling you that once you crack this, life is set. That's the real trap. As Taleb says, the feeling of having things are the ones which give rise the stress and fear of losing those (bank balance included). Also if in any unfortunate circumstances if you stand to lose more than you can gain (you'll be in this position very quickly), your stress is going to be very high. I experience this every single freaking day of my life. That's in a nutshell about how life's gonna be. The moments that make up life are going to be loaded with one kind of feeling or the other. Choose wisely depending on how you got into this place to start with. And if you're generally asking how life is after this degree, there are again two possibilities One, you're curious. Rest assured life is rich and comfortable. Two, you're jealous. Rest assured it's not easy (note in none of the above possibilities I mention life being easy anyway).

NPTEL is a great source of knowledge. Professors from various IITs teaching courses ranging from introductory level to advanced level. Many of these courses are standard compulsory courses in engineering degree offered by any university. Others are offered as electives, some of which could be exclusive to top tier colleges. So the pace of the courses is similar to any course taken in a semester and the number of weeks will depend on the depth of the course and the credits offered for that course in that IIT. The good side of these courses is that you will gain the fundamentals of the subject in a way very similar to classroom courses. The negative side is that not everyone has so much time and patience. Also the certification exams are generally too easy, pretty much the same as weekly assignments and nothing compared to the vast syllabus and the great depth covered in the course. (But I have heard some rare courses having difficult certification exams). If you're an engineering student(assuming from your question because of comparison with IITians), you should take NPTEL courses: If you're not convinced with the quality of teaching at your college. Be it core fundamental courses or electives.If you want to learn beyond the scope of your college's academic curriculum.If you want to learn about a stream other than yours. Like a CSE student interested in Mechanical engineering.In any of these cases, NPTEL is a good place to start . For any successful engineer, the qualification is more than just knowledge gained from courses. You have to do projects, get hands-on experience. The specifics depend on the stream. I can speak for CS Engineers that they can explore and do projects and much more. Competitive coding, open source contribution, putting up a project on github with or without collaboration, online competitions in field of interest and the list goes on. Your relevance in the industry increases with the experience you get from such self-interested efforts. Also, do explore websites like Coursera and edX which offer a lot of online courses and certifications. If you're a professional in the industry already(just in case, because I have seen such people appearing for NPTEL exams), then take NPTEL courses only if your employer recognizes NPTEL certifications and it helps for your project/portfolio/promotion. With all due respect to NPTEL courses, I feel certifications from the likes of Microsoft, Google, IBM are valued more(available in websites like coursera, edx). Finally, ‚ÄúIITian knowledge‚Äù is not a standard. The goal of any student, IITian or not, is to be the best they can be in their streams.

All this happened under the nose of the authorities. After a year, he filed nomination for the post of GSHA against the Mood Indigo supported X, who in his ISHA tenure failed to meet his basic duties. The result was that Y lost by 44 votes only and the reasons were the misconduct of election under the supervision of the election committee which was biased towards X. The polling booths were captured in some hostels. The official time of closing the voting was 11 PM but people favoring X were allowed to vote even after that.

This letter forced the authorities to take a glance at the allegations that are raised by a majority of SGSC members towards current GSHA and GSSA  2 Days later - A freshie was ragged by current GSSA The Election Committee members forcefully detained two freshmen from the middle of their NSO session and they were taken to SAC without any prior permission from Dean(SA) nor a prior notice was given to the students.

I got the interview call for the MTech environmental engineering so I'm eligible to answer this question. Disclaimer: Here I'm just sharing my and my friend's experience (who also attended the interview and he is also form chemical engineering background) and it may have different for each person. I reach to the department late from actual time because at the same time I had another written test. This is allowed by department to come late because I had valid reason. After reaching there I had to wait for document verification and at that pannel was allotted to me by TA (Teaching assistant). There were 5 pannels. I think 2nd pannel was allotted to me (not remember exactly). After all formalities I went to the interview room there were 3 memeber in the pannel. First I greeted them and they offered me chair for sitting. Then interview started I am form chemical engineering background so they started with basic questions of chemical engineering. Then they see my departmental priority check list and see my preference of environmental engineering department. (Priority list is the one when you submit your online form you have to set preference for each department.) The interview was going normal they have asked me basic questions and few conceptual questions and I answered them well too. Then one member asked me a question related to probability and distribution which answer I didn't know then I deny politely. Then another member asked be the assumption taken to generate Langmuir isotherm used for adsorption but I didn't remember it so I deny and my interview got over. Now I'm sharing my one friend's experience. He was allotted to some another pannel and he told me that his pannel member were very strict. They asked him about his final year BTech project and some difficult questions of chemical engineering as well as related to environmental engineering. So finally I conclude that it mostly depends upon pannel members. But I think the basic knowledge of environmental engineering you studied during your undergraduate curriculum will be helpful. From my experience I can say that generally they prefer to asked questions related to your core field. Thanks for reading. I hope it helps you. :-) ",0.9642,Positive,5,0.0,0,5

You have to submit your application along with your Resume, a Statement of Purpose of about 500 words, and an NOC from your institute. From the many applications, the professors will select the best fit for the project considering your CGPA, previous projects and motivation for research (Statement of Purpose). It is a 2 month internship where you will recieve a stipend of INR 2500 per week. Now coming to the difficulty part, it depends on the project and Professor you choose. Some projects are selected by about 100 students while some are selected by 10 students. The professor will select one or two students from these depending on their requirement. So, it is fairly selective but I guess with a high CGPA (9+) and projects in the given field, you have a very good chance of acceptance. These programs usually focus more on CGPA and less on projects, but even if you have a less CGPA but high motivation and have done good projects, you can apply directly to professors. Apart from these designated programs, you can also mail a professor directly with whom you want to do a project for summers. He will look upon your work and may select you for internship.

The number of seats in IITs is increasing every year, however new hostels are not being created that fast.

IIT Delhi was the first IIT that was forced to provide off-campus accommodation last year. Even in other IITs there will be consequences. Others like IIT Kanpur which had the privilege to provide single rooms to M.Techs may not have the same privilege this year.

It's not that you won't get placement in IITB, because companies need expertise in VLSI. The knowledge as well as expertise in tools that you will get after doing PG courses will give a tough competition to sharp mind of IITB btech people. 2)If you are more interested in Analog and RF circuit design and don't like coding that much, IISC will be a better place for you. The level of mtech project that you will get in IISC is tough and you will learn a lot. Texas instruments sponsors 3‚Äì4 candidates for internship after first semester and mostly all of them converts their internship to PPO. In IISC you will design circuits related to radars,mmwave and 5G. However if you are interested to design ckts related to biomedical side then IITB will be a better place for you. You can compare profiles of Dr.Gaurab Banerjee and Dr.Maryam Baghini to know which will suit you better. 3) If you are interested device modelling and fabrication side, both of them have clean room facilities and you can expect high quality research in both institutes. 4) For digital VLSI, I can say both institutes are having good faculties and placements are really good for both of them. Mostly same companies will come for placements in both institutes. Since I'm not into digital side, I can't compare exactly the differences between IITB and IISC but I will give you guarantee that if you have worked hard enoguh you won't remain jobless. No of companies that will hire for Digital VLSI domain are far greater than companies that hire of analog VLSI domain. Best way to compare these institutes in terms of research area is by looking at research interests of professors in IISC and IITB.

Seniors or those working please give your valuable advice?,3,1,3/1,No,Followed,2020-03-28,/How-much-coding-is-required-for-clearing-tests-for-Analytics-Data-science-companies-in-IIT-placements-Seniors-or-those-working-please-give-your-valuable-advice,"What is Data Science? Data science is a field focused on finding actionable insights from large sets of raw and structured data. The field primarily focuses on discovering answers to the things we don‚Äôt know. Data science specialists use numerous different techniques to obtain answers, including computer science, predictive analytics, statistics, and machine learning to analyze through huge datasets in an attempt to discover solutions to the problems that haven't crossed their mind. What is Data Analytics? Data analytics (DA) is the process of analyzing data sets to conclude the information they contain, frequently with the help of specialized systems and software. Data analytics technologies and techniques are widely used in commercial industries to aid organizations to make more-versed business decisions and are used by scientists and researchers to verify or disapprove scientific models, theories and hypotheses. Data analytics focuses more on processing and performing statistical analysis of datasets that already exist. Analysts focus on creating methods to capture, process, and organize data to reveal insights for modern problems, and discovering the best way to manifest this data. You can take the Data Analytics Online Course to grab all the knowledge that you need. What is the Placement Pattern? The placement process has two parts. 1. Coding + Aptitude Test You need to appear for a test to get shortlisted for the interview ( only if you clear the test). This test is generally basic coding questions in your preferred language. Some companies might give only coding questions to perform and others might give MCQs as well as coding questions. The coding tests are mostly conducted on platforms like hackerrank or hackathon. Plus, Aptitude test which includes areas like quantitative, verbal and logical reasoning (For IT field) and core questions + Aptitude (for other fields). So, it's a must that you learn to code if you dream to get placed in an IT company. (be it SDE, Data Science or Analyst). What to Prepare? CODING CHALLENGEFor Coding, you must practice online coding hackathons or basic to advance coding tests on platforms like HackerRank. Coding requires practice and if you want to clear that first step in placements then the coding is a must for IT sector students. Coding challenges can range from a simple coding question to more complicated problems like building a time series forecasting model using messy data. These challenges will be timed based on how complicated the questions are. Challenges can be hosted on sites such as HackerRank, CoderByte, and even internal company solutions. APTITUDE TESTThe aptitude test for analytics jobs such as for consultants and business analysts includes areas like quantitative, verbal and logical reasoning. The idea to conduct an aptitude test is to check your comfort with numbers and how good are you at crunching them, as that is the essence of analytics jobs. Analytics aptitude tests in most companies have quantitative sections from areas like time and work, compound interest, mixture and allegations, calendars, etc., while that from logical reasoning and English include alphabet series, patterns, syllogism, seating arrangement, coding-decoding, a logical puzzle, easy reading comprehension, etc. The areas with most focus are analytical thinking, data interpretation, data sufficiency, comprehension, writing skills. While the level of quantitative aptitude is moderate, it forms a deciding factor if you would make it to the technical round, which tests your understanding in the core subject. Usually, in most analytics companies the aptitude exam carries 60% of the overall weightage, and these tests are conducted online. Some of the online tests also consist of case study simulators to judge a candidate‚Äôs analytical abilities in real-life scenarios. 2. Technical interview At this stage of the interview process, you‚Äôll have an opportunity to be interviewed by a technical member of the team. So be prepared for data science interviews that companies conduct. Some data science interviews are very product and metric-driven. These interviews focus more on asking product questions like what kind of metrics would you use to show what you should improve in a product. These are often paired with SQL and some Python questions. The other type of data science interview tends to be a mix of programming and machine learning. Some tips for the interview:1. Read the role and company description. 2. Always read your resume before the interview. 3. Come prepared with questions. Look at Glassdoor to get some insight into the type of questions that may come up. 4. Don‚Äôt criticize your current or past companies. It rarely will benefit you. 5. Research who is going to interview you. A machine learning engineer with a Ph.D. will interview you differently than a data analyst. ",0.9931,Positive,5,0.03260869565217391,1,5

The development by ‚ÄúFabiosys Innovations‚Äù, a start-up incubated at IIT-Delhi, comes at a time when the world is dealing with the deadly coronavirus outbreak. However, the team has been working on the project for over a year with support from the government‚Äôs Department of Science and Technology. According to official statistics from the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, for every 100 hospitalised patients in developing countries, 10 acquire HAIs and the risk is even higher at the time of a coronavirus outbreak. The team claims to have developed an affordable, novel textile-processing technology, which converts regular cotton fabric into infection-proof fabric. As per Department of Textile and Fibre Engineering, IIT-Delhi: rolls of cotton fabric are treated with a set of proprietary-developed chemicals under a set of particular reaction conditions, using the machinery already commonly available in textile industries. The fabric, after undergoing these processes, gains the powerful antimicrobial functionality. What is interesting about the Fabiosys‚Äô fabric is that even after washing multiple times, it does not lose its functionality. This fabric can be stitched into various articles such as bedsheets, the uniforms for patients, doctors and nurses and even curtains. The fabric satisfies the Indian washing standards in terms of number of washing. It is also completely non-toxic and affordable. IIT has collaborated with the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) for a pilot run of the product. While talking to a few patients at the AIIMS, the IIT researchers came to know that they became more sick after getting admitted there. While researching, they found that hospital-acquired infections (HAIs) are a grave problem, especially in developing countries like India, where the tropical climatic conditions are suitable for the growth of bacteria. It was surprising to see that many patients are not even aware about HAIs. People usually become aware of any cross-contamination when it has already taken the form of an outbreak or epidemic. The recent case of coronavirus is one such example. One of the major ways these infections spread is through contact from contaminated surfaces and a patient in a hospital is surrounded by a variety of fabric in the form of bedsheets, the uniforms for patients, doctors and nurses etc. and these textile surfaces actually become the breeding ground for pathogens, which do not get killed even while washing in hot water. The research team of IIT-Delhi is currently in the process of conducting large-scale manufacturing trials in the Delhi-NCR region in collaboration with AIIMS, Delhi to pilot these products. The team is also in early talks with some of the largest hospital chains in India for further pilots and strategic collaborations. They have been financially supported by the Department of Science and Technology, Ministry of Human Resource Development, IIT Delhi and Department of Biotechnology in the form of grants and fellowships.

But I know what it really is. Everyone has a childhood image of themselves in the future, a special someone. But you know what? As you grow older, you become okay with being ordinary. You become okay with not being the best in the world, maybe just the best among the people who surround you every day. I would first like to ask you, what do you know about your area of interest, beyond it's definition? Have you read any research papers, done any online courses? And about EP at IIT, have you looked into the course structure, do you think it contains subjects related to your area of interest? What is the point of even pursuing this course? Honestly, I'm not blaming you. Who knows about any of this before JEE. Only after JEE do you first hear the word branch, course, placement, whatever. Now to the more important part: Your dream. It is to pursue research in quantum computing. Let's say you get into IIT, and in that department. You would keep up your pride till about a month or two till you realise your branch has little relevance with your research area and as in other spheres, it would have been better if you were in CS or EE. As you grow older, and placement season beckons, you realise your dreams would be long forgotten. You would be looking to take up data structures and algorithms in some semester, code rapidly and becoming a software developer would be your dream by the time you were through third year. The reason is simple, money. Maybe you have your pride till second year. But when you see the job forms that companies send out, when the salaries per annum are shared with you by your seniors, and you find out that to earn more than 10 lpa you have to learn to crack coding interviews, your pride shatters. You realise by the end of second year that research is not all that it seems, there is too much luck involved. At least, to make up for it you need a stable job. PhD? No way, only losers who don't get jobs do that! Fast forward a couple of years, and you will be comfortably settled in a developer/management role (gave CAT?) and earning upwards of 30 lpa (lower bound). You could care less about your youthful dream. The only purpose of IIT in your life was to bring the software gods to interview you and graciously grant you an offer you could not refuse. Yes, this is (in short) the main reason why it is desirable to get into IIT. I would say just focus on studies for now, and stop spamming on Quora.

530,530,Indian-Institute-of-Technology-Bombay-IITB,How is IIT Bombay for an MTech in VLSI from a placement perspective?,7,1,7/1,Yes,Followed,2020-03-16,/How-is-IIT-Bombay-for-an-MTech-in-VLSI-from-a-placement-perspective,"Each specialisation of M.Tech in IIT Bombay is divided in to two categories, TA(2 years) and RA(3 years).This is not the case with any other IITs as all the other IITs have only TAs. Both TA and RA category will have almost the same number of students. Since you are interested in VLSI, you must be interested in EE5, EE6 or EE7 (note that EE4 is now discontinued as it has been separated into EE6 and EE7) of IIT B. If you are looking for placements then EE7 is out of question as it is completely devices based course. Hence if you have taken EE7 and want to compete in placements you have to work extra hard and do the courses of EE5/EE6 also. Before I answer the question about placements let me also mention GATE ranks in ECE required to get admission in EE6 of IIT Bombay:- TA => less than 50 for General Category RA => Upto 1000 TAs are direct admission, whereas RAs have to go though additional rounds of interview. Before I get into the details about placement, let me get a few thing straight. First, when you are in an interview your GATE rank and whether you are an RA or a TA makes no difference !!! All that matters is your CPI(well... to some extent), the projects you have done in your IIT curriculum, the knowledge you have gained in your M.Tech and a bit of luck too üòÖ. Second, the VLSI placements in all the IITs and IISc are same, i.e. same companies visit all the IITs. Now let's answer the elephant in the room...... 'HOW ARE THE PLACEMENTS WHEN COMPARED TO IIT DELHI, IIT KHARAGPUR, IIT MADRAS & IISC ?' Well the answer also depends on whether you are a TA or an RA. So if you are an RA, you have additional 1 year to prepare for placements. And also the number of courses you have to take each semester is much lesser, so you can focus better on concepts, have higher CPI and do more research work. On the other hand a TA has to do the same courses in 2 years and hence placement preparation time is lesser and doesn't have much time to spare for research work. Hence during placements RAs have a big advantage. Because of RA admission the M.Tech intake of IIT Bombay is double and IIT Bombay still don't allow internships(this may change in future). Hence no way of getting PPOs. To give some numbers, around 56 M.Tech students appeared for 2019 placements in IIT Bombay for VLSI alone, whereas IIT Kgp and Madras had around 15-20, IIT Delhi around 10 and IISC had even fewer as internships and PPOs are allowed in IISC. Note that these numbers don't include B.Techs and Dual degrees. As vacancies are not that much in VLSI industry, placing 56 students is a challenge. IIT Bombay has nothing special to offer....... well it has one thing to offer, the increased competition and anxiety during placements as compared to other IITs mentioned above. To give you some numbers, almost all the VLSI students in IIT KGP, IISc and IIT Delhi were placed in Day 1. Whereas IIT Bombay VLSI placements went on till DAY 3. After day 3 there were no VLSI companies. At the end 99% VLSI students were placed in IIT Bombay ........ even dettol can't kill 100% bacteria :P. So for anyone willing to seek admission in IIT Bombay I would suggest 3 things:- 1) If you have got rank under 50(or even under 100), then I would suggest your 1st preference should be DESE in IISC followed by IIT Delhi VDTT or IIT Madras VLSI or IIT Kharagpur VLSI or or TI MS course in IIT Madras for an anxiety free placement season. 2) If you have got rank under 50(or even under 100) and have 3 years to spare, join as RA in IIT Bombay. As you have already scored a good rank, it shows you will be well ahead of other RAs in basic technical concepts and most probably are hard working too. You can spend much more time in doing R&D projects which will further augment your technical knowledge. 3) If your rank is not that great, DESE in IISC should be your 1st preference followed by M.Tech RA in IIT Bombay or TI MS course in IIT Madras. But if you want to ride the IIT Bombay hype train and ready to give your all in the placement season, come join IIT Bombay as a TA !!! 2019 placement stats of a few companies for EE4 and EE5 in IIT Bombay(what my memory can recall....)

But I never used my JEST score to apply to IISc. I was very much clear that I wanted to go for IIT Bombay over IISc Bangalore. Following are the reasons (in random order of importance): 1. I am brought up in Mumbai and it's difficult to let go off the city once you get the hang of it. (And it was just awesome of a feeling to be a travel guide for my friends I made at IIT Bombay) 2. I wanted a green lush campus. I am quite of a scenary person. Moreover, IIT Bombay shares it's boundary with Powai lake. And I am definitely a water person.

Later stages -> Some of my besties had BFs and they insisted me to have GF to know what Love is ! I had a fair idea of proposing to someone who speak my language and also from a technical background. Motivation and Information When I was in the first year of my PhD at IIT Madras, my sister got married. My parents started telling me that their duty will be over if I get married. I also agreed to the same. I told that ‚ÄúChoice is mine and I will go for Love cum Arranged Marriage"". Immediately my mom puts forth a condition stating that you need to find a girl from our community only. I obliged to the condition and said that I will start my search. One fine evening, every one from my maternal side gathered in my uncle's home near IIT and i was invited for dinner. I went to meet all to have good time and again they started about marriage topic. My aunt gives an information that they went to their distant relative‚Äôs place for a holiday and stayed in their home for a couple of days. There the host had two children and the elder one is a girl with spec who is an engineer and worked for a MNC and pursuing masters during that time. My aunt told me that ‚Äúshe will be a best partner for you‚Äù. Search for my girl The information given to me didn't allow my heart and mind to sleep. As usual my aunt instilled the info in a way it made me curious. ‚ÄúHow to find her ?‚Äù is what scrolling on my forehead. Don't know the name and no contact info given to me. I have no intention to ask about the details. I came to know about the relationship tree of their families and somehow found their family name. Now started searching social media about the same with the only keyword. Facebook search yielded me many names with same family name. I was going through each and every profile to find who she is and get connected. After a through search, i could not find anyone due to missing display picture. I was little frustrated. The same day during night i started my search operation and i found her cousin's profile who was my cousin's BIL. Nature gives us Right Information at Right Time. I went through his friend list and found my girl's profile. Proposal and Acceptance After locating the profile, immediately gave a friend request. The time was past 23:00 Hrs IST. I kept watching the facebook page and refreshed it often. Fifteen minutes passed by and i had a notification. OMG she had accepted my friend request. I went to cloud nine. I immediately went to messenger from the profile and started typing. Greetings followed by few Introductory messages. Desperately waiting for her reply. I got a very professional response and followed by a Bye. I didn't disturb her and went to sleep happily. Next day, I was online to chat with her and she came online around the same time. Exchanged greetings and she told me that she is doing assignments. I asked for appointment to chat and she replied ‚Äúwhenever you find me online next day, chat with me‚Äù. Next day came, I was waiting online as she created eagerness to chat. She came online around 23 Hrs IST. As usual we exchanged greetings and I directly started saying why I gave her friend request and asked her why she accepted my request. She gave me the answer that her maternal uncle attended her cousin's marriage (in deed my cousin's marriage too) and took my Photograph and sent to her. I remember that gentleman who was nice to me interacting and asked for photo. I asked whether she attended the marriage and she answered no. I knew by that time she has seen my latest picture and I found her old profile pic with slight out of focus and less clarity. Without hesitation, I asked for lot of details about her stating that I wanted to know as I am proposing for a marriage. She didn't respond me and went offline. Note that she didn't give her contact details except FB connection. I was online for a week waiting for her to come online but she didn't. I was thinking that I might have made a mistake by asking too much details in a go but it was mandatory for both. Days passed by and one fine day I got a message from her with sorry and she expressed that my questions and request for details were correct. She answered to my questions and this confirmed my proposal and her acceptance to the same (Still didn't propose directly). Confirmation and subsequent story We exchanged numbers and started chatting by messages. Then moved to WhatsApp. One fine weekend, I received a message that she wanted to speak to me and after a long hesitation, I said okay we can speak. She called me and I was nervous as it was the first time to talk directly. We spoke for fifteen minutes and out of blue she asked me when will you propose ? I replied that I had already proposed in the chat. She didn't accept that and asked for proposal via phone. I went ahead saying ‚ÄúI Love You My Wife‚Äù and received a blushing response ‚ÄúLove you too My Hubby‚Äù. Chats became mandatory and we were always on call via Reliance - Thanks to Ambani ! After few months our families exchanged horoscopes and went ahead with meeting between parents leading to fixing marriage date and so on. This all happened without any meeting of myself with my fiancee ! The meeting happened just few weeks before marriage and that can be a separate story - as it is more interesting and lengthy. Got married and settled near IIT and I received a hike in scholarship due to HRA (wink). Love stories continues forever. We can find many interesting love stories that happened in IITs. Mine was first in my lab and subsequently my lab mates also had love cum arranged marriages. Love is Life | Live to Love | Love to Live Happy Moments ! ",0.9996,Positive,5,0.17391304347826086,1,5

Both IIT delhi and IIT Bombay have performed well in QS World University subject rankings 2020 ( subject area: Engineering & Technology , different subjects) . Both are different Rankings. Now moving to your question. Do they deserve it. Offcourse yes. Both these Institutions are poorly funded. Unlike Harvard, MIT they do not have huge endowment funds to support them . Even with poor funding both these IITs have highest scores in citations per paper and citations per faculty. This is the only parameter which boosts their QS rankings. The alumni of these institutions do not provide much financial support. Research without funding and infrastructure is very difficult to achieve. Most of the IIT alumnus do not support there parent institutes. They don't pay back their Guru Dakshina unlike the US institutes which have huge endowment funds. A brief look at the below table will amaze you.  Even some research labs of MIT and Harvard have more budget than the entire 5 year budget of IIT delhi and IIT bombay together.

As an IITian from another IIT, I can argue against this, in favour of my own, or even others which have top billing(Madras, Delhi, Kanpur, Kgp,Guwahati, Roorkee or BHU). I will still try to explain why it is perceived so, though. 1)Most top JEE rankers prefer it. 2)Location and hype(justified or not is disputable) of placement opportunities, MS permits etc. 3)More media glare as TOI and many leading Indian papers are based out of this city. 4)Some name-recognised researchers in their faculty list who have genuinely advanced their fields at par with their counterparts in MIT, Harvard etc. Holds for other IITs too but they donnot have that level of fanfare though‚Ä¶. 5)Herd mentality and self-reinforcing prophecy of sorts by word-of-mouth. 6) Alumni outcome- success of individuals who are alimni of the institution does contribute to its fame.

However, to answer your question - The IITs have traditionally done well in the tough parameters, like Research Output, and Infrastructure. They lose out on 3 parameters in such global rankings - Faculty Student Ratio, %age of foreign faculty, %age of foreign students. Given the poor quality of PhD education in India, the IITs find it difficult to attract and retain good faculty. And they don't want to compromise either. Hence, the perennial shortage of faculty, especially at IIT Bombay and IIT Delhi. High student intake, lack of ‚Äòquality‚Äô teachers lead to staff shortage at IITs Given the constraints that IITs operate under, especially with caps on salaries and student fees, these institutes do not have the financial resources to make foreign professors leave their jobs in other universities. We have yet to reach the tipping point for industry to start giving large research projects to the IITs, because the R&D spend in India is miniscule. However, we are getting there. Also many IITs have now started Endowment Funds, which should hopefully bring much needed revenue to the institutes in the coming days, so that they can operate free from their financial shackles. IIT Delhi launches Global Alumni Endowment Fund, targets $1 billion over 7 years Now, all IITs, IIMs will launch endowment funds to tap successful alumni for donations Having said all this, it is pretty common for IIT graduates to do very well in the top 5 global institutes for their Masters degrees. Many of them get scholarships as well. Many of the students from these foreign universities doing exchange programs in the IITs face difficulty in coping with the demanding syllabus back there. So, in terms of calibre, I believe there is not much of a difference. It's just that those institutes attract the best talent from across the world, and our IITs attract the best talent from across India, which is barely 15% of the global set.

But our grandmother taught us to retain dignity at all costs, a value that‚Äôs stayed with me until today.

It was a great time -- the weather was beautiful, I had my own car and I loved my job. It was in LA that I fell in love and almost got married.

In such assignments, demonstration of a working implementation is key to getting a good grade. which encourage student to do well in that. and Collaborations with Indian industry majors such as TCS as well as multinationals such as Google, VMware, Microsoft, IBM, HP, and NetApp are also helping towards industry readiness. Academics get a source of relevant problems to solve with their research students (PhD, Master‚Äôs, or even undergrads who like research) that can result in impactful contributions. Industry partners can get solutions and often prototype implementations of novel ideas, and also get potential trained R&D recruits. if I talk about my own department companies like john deere, DHL, TCS, hospitals like TMH and central government‚Äôs Railways come to solve unique problems that they are facing in optimization or may be they want to improve their current existing system.

I'll try to give my point of view on NITIE and IITB. PGDIE/MM/PM courses at NITIE are run more like an MBA course than like an m.tech course (again Choice is yours). Curriculum wise (as per my some NITIE friends), in NITIE you have less load/stress of curriculum, the project is also taken lightly (barring few profs). But there's a load for getting a right internship. The curriculum has some basic management subjects like accounts, HR and rest is domain-specific. One has the option of taking some electives, but I don't know the width of the electives offered. At IEOR IITB, the curriculum is not light and chill (not very heavy as well). Here one learns things like optimization, supply chain, game theory, simulation techniques, system dynamics, Machine learning, deep learning. The width number of electives available is vast, and way more than a student can do. So one has more options for electives. The curriculum is mixed, industry-oriented and research-oriented. One gets to take the flavour of both kinds. Talking about Social life. NITIE is a small institute, while IITB is a gigantic institute, Has best in class sports facilities (compared to any technical institute of the country). I don't need to say anything about MoodI and Techfest. There are other fests as well. About Placements. IEOR and NITIE placement is almost certain (though it does take a lot of personal efforts no matter the institute, institute gives you opportunities, you have to make them count). IEOR candidates get placed in different kinds of organizations and profiles like Data analytics, machine learning, financial services, Core-optimization job profiles, supply chain management and software engineer. Jobs are of both kinds research and non-research. NITIE candidates are placed in FMCG(for supply chain management, operations management), other supply chain management related jobs, banks etc. IEOR average package is around 12 LPA while I am not sure about NITIE, but it is well above 15 LPA. But one big difference many of the IEOR candidates have variable pays over and above the mentioned figure while that's not the case for NITIE. PS: If you have the slightest doubt that you may want to do a PhD in the future or have a taste of research, IEOR IITB is the place (to get a perspective during M.tech and decide for PhD). And if you want a course like an MBA and want a job in that domain, NITIE is the place. ",0.9963,Positive,5,0.06521739130434782,1,5

It focuses on the way that human beings and computers interact to ever increasing levels of both complexity and simplicity. It‚Äôs perhaps easy to see that until the mid to late 1970s this discipline wasn‚Äôt particularly important. The few people who had access to computers were academics or professionals with a few incredibly dedicated (and wealthy) hobbyists thrown into the mix. Without a broad base of users; it wasn‚Äôt necessary to focus on how those users interacted with computers ‚Äì they just made do with whatever was to hand or created what they needed themselves.  It‚Äôs a Very New Discipline Then with the dawn of personal computing; the flood gates opened. The masses wanted computing and they didn‚Äôt want to go through complicated rigmarole to do what they wanted with a computer. They weren‚Äôt prepared to build and program their own joysticks for the games they bought, they didn‚Äôt expect to design the mouse before they could use a word processor and so on‚Ä¶ Cognitive Sciences Luckily, for the masses, there was a discipline waiting in the wings to help with the tasks that lay ahead. Cognitive sciences (a broad and heady mix which includes psychology, language, artificial intelligence, philosophy and even anthropology) had been making steady progress during the 1970s and by the end of the decade they were ready to help articulate the systems and science required to develop user interfaces that worked for the masses.  Engineering This is known as ‚Äúcognitive engineering‚Äù e.g. building things that work with our thoughts. And once again the engineering discipline had also come on leaps and bounds during the 1970s in order to support this change. In aviation, for example, engineering had already started to simplify the user interface of complex airplanes. It was natural for some of this work to move into the UI field for computing devices. Documentation It‚Äôs also important to recognize the challenge of documenting these developments. New systematic approaches needed to be taken in order to record developments and to share these with other practitioners of the new discipline worldwide. There really is, after all, no advantage in reinventing the mouse over and over again. John Carroll the Edward Frymoyer Chair Professor of Information Sciences and Technology at the Pennsylvania State University says that the discipline of Human Computer Interaction was born (or perhaps ‚Äúemerged‚Äù is a better word) in 1980 as all these separate disciplines began to realign around a single objective; making computing easier for the masses.

IIT Bombay has currently experienced escalation in its ranking as a leading engineering institution on a nationwide basis. On a global basis, IIT Bombay is placed at a decent rank of 219. Now I would focus on your question which asks that for what IIT Bombay is known for. Currently most of students have been fascinated by a common notion about this institution I.e. Excellence in the department of Computer Science Engineering (CSE). However given the gravity of the current situation other IITs like IIT Delhi have the capability of imparting the same amount of excellence in the mentioned department(note that this doesn't apply to the newer set of IITs). This notion is mostly due to myth of high packages for the graduates (The package gets higher for a dual degree holder). P.s- IIT Bombay is also well known due to Mr Veerwal.

Firstly there is no comparison between IITs and MIT. Even if all IITs stand together they are no match for MIT. This is harsh but it's truth. IITs alumni are great. But MIT alumni base is super great. MIT receive huge amount of funds from alumni and industries. Where as IITs struggle to receive funds from alumni. MIT infrastructure is world class. None of the IITs labs and resources can match with the MIT. Although I am not been to MIT but this is my opinion. In IITs handful of faculties are great. But in MIT you can find huge number of faculties which are great in research and teaching. Another main disadvantage in IITs is they have to follow strict government policies. In IITs people usually focus on publishing number of paper not on the quality. But it's not the case with MIT they focuses on both. ,0.986,Positive,5,0.0,0,5

Praveen Kumar Singh's answer to What is the average package in aerospace engineering at IIT Kanpur?It is extremely hard for any Indian IIT student to become a real computer engineer because computer engineering is extremely complex and no Indian engineering college offer these facilities to its students to the maximum possible extent which encourages free thinking and gives ample time to its students to gain industry relevant skills.Since most of the IIT graduates become either a programmer or a manager hence there is NO use of teaching many different engineering branches in IITs(or India).

In the ‚Äô30s, the movie business was supposed to be a ‚Äòdirty business‚Äô. People would talk about movies, but many wouldn‚Äôt even consider going to watch one. This would be similar to people talking about gold prices but seldom buying it. Even though movies did make people curious, its reputation as a professional field was bad. There seemed to be a lack of respect for the profession because it was being considered the domain of undesirable sections of the then Indian society. Due to this lack of respect and understanding for the profession, financiers during those times would face an impossible challenge when it came to getting returns on their investment. ‚Äã It was during this hunt for financiers that Himanshu Rai came in contact with Abhimanyu Prasad Singh, a close friend of Seth Badriprasad Dube, who was a well-known financier. He introduced Himanshu Rai, a London return actor/ theatre artist to Seth Badriprasad Dube with a dream of making a cinema company but Seth Badriprasad declined the proposal of funding Himanshu Rai because Seth Badriprasad had once financed the first Indian Talkie film Alam Ara which dint earn him any profit and he made an opinion that of only actors and directors get fame but the financier doesn‚Äôt get profits. During that era, the film business was not considered as money earning business. It was more about the passion for cinema and getting fame. Because of this fact, Seth Badriprasad Dube declined the proposal of financing Himanshu Rai. ‚Äã Abhimanyu Singh spoke next to Seth Badriprasad‚Äôs son Shri. Rajnarayan Dube. He was a young and dynamic businessman who operated a successful company called Dube Industries, which he had founded in 1929. Shri. Dube was born on 10th October 1910 at Kalighat in Kolkata and was an ardent devotee of Maa Kali. He was influenced by the power of art and creativity at a young age. Both men met at the Taj Mahal Hotel in Colaba, Mumbai (Bombay) and discussed an initial investment amount of Rs. 25 lakhs. However, Himanshu Rai couldn‚Äôt convince Rajnarayan Dube to invest the amount because of the dismal returns on investment that the Indian movie industry offered. At this point, it would seem that Bombay Talkies would never come to be, but things have a way of working out in unexpected ways. A few months passed by and Himanshu Rai had grown increasingly despondent because it was becoming impossible to raise investment for his movie company. In his depression, the man attempted suicide but was unsuccessful. Shri. Rajnarayan Dube got wind of this through Abhimanyu Prasad Singh and wondered about this man, one who so completely and wholeheartedly believed in the power of cinema and talking pictures that he did not see it fit to continue living if he couldn‚Äôt follow his dreams. Rajnarayan Dube decided that Himanshu Rai was onto something here and finalized the investment with him soon after. In doing this, Shri. Rajnarayan Dube went deliberately against the advice of his father, Seth Badriprasad Dube, who felt that this would not be a good investment choice. In doing this, Shri. Rajnarayan Dube gave birth to the Indian Film Industry, which has now gone on to become a huge cultural and financial force in the country. At the very nascent age of the cinema Rajnarayan Dube‚Äôs Bombay Talkies was born in India when other contemporary film companies of the world such as Warner Bros. Entertainment, Universal Pictures, 20th Century Fox, Paramount Pictures were born and brought up to create cinematic magic for the world audience, but Bombay Talkies (under the command of Girish Ghanshyam Dube), is the only premier film company which has made charismatic comeback and repeating its old pride and glory after sixty-three years of utter darkness. ‚Äã Cinematic Giant and Pillar of Indian Cinema, Rajnarayan Dube founded the Legendary Film Company, The Bombay Talkies Studios along with its associate companies Bombay Talkies Laboratories and Bombay Talkies Pictures as individual proprietorship companies. At the same time to add more people, he established the first public limited film company of India The Bombay Talkies Limited (ltd.) in 1934, although all companies were commonly known as Bombay Talkies. As Himanshu Rai and Devika Rani were actors they were given some shares of the company as their remuneration. Some films were produced under the banner of The Bombay Talkies Limited also, but most of the films were produced under The Bombay Talkies Studios and Bombay Talkies Pictures. The Bombay Talkies Studios also successfully Distributed, Processed and Promoted films of other producers and banners other than their own films. All the films were financed by Rajnarayan Dube in his individual capacity as the owner of his proprietorship finance company Dube Industries (Estd. 1929). On 15 April 1934, Bombay Talkies began operations. The movie company was named by Shri. Dube‚Äôs mother, Smt. Gayatri Devi. Though Light of Asia and Karma a concept which Himanshu Rai built during his days in Europe, it was released in 1925 and 1933 respectively. As the release went unnoticed, Rajnarayan Dube re-released them and the first films to come out of the stables were Light of Asia (Prem Sanyas) and Karma in 1934. It was followed by Jawani ki Hawa, Achhut Kanya, and Jeevan Naiya. The movie company-operated along with a principle of keeping the creative aspects and business aspects separate. Shri. Rajnarayan Dube would look into the business end of things and both Himanshu Rai and Devika Rani would immerse themselves in the creative pursuit. This approach gave rise to some of the most technically impressive films seen this side of the planet. The technical prowess was due to the movie studio employing German and other European technicians, prominent among them being Franz Osten. Rajnarayan Dube‚Äôs Bombay Talkies was single-handedly responsible for making the careers of some of the leading talent in the golden age of Indian cinema. Besides Himanshu Rai and Devika Rani, the company gave the world Ashok Kumar, Leela Chitnis, Madhubala (who began as a child artist and was given her stage name by Rajnarayan Dube himself, Dilip Kumar, Raj Kapoor, Dev Anand, Leela Chitnis, David Abraham Cheulkar, Phani Majumdar, Gyan Mukherjee, K.A.

D. Burman, Manna Dey, Saraswati Devi (who was the first woman music director of Asia) and now Megastar Aazaad. All in all, Bombay Talkies gave the world 280 of the most talented movie professionals in the last century. Under the command of Rajnarayan Dube, Bombay Talkies had Produced 115 films like Achhut Kannya, Kismet, Bandhan, Mahal, Jhoola, Jeevan Naiya, Neel Kamal, Baadbaan, Daag, Majboor, Drishtidan (Bengali), Izzat, Prem Kahani, Punarmilan, Aawaz, Pratima, Raj Mahal, Apnapan, Anyaya, Roti, Farar, Ziddi, Mashal, Azad, Jwar Bhata, Basant, Sangram, Patita, Bhabi (1938), Durga, Kala Patthar, Indian Lady, Jeevan Prabhat, HamariBaat, Anand, Aurangzeb, Bemisaal, Mamta, Sipahi, Milan, Naya Sansar, Anjaan, Adalat, Aandolan, Zindagi, Zamindar, Kanjoos, Ravan, Raja Rani, Phaansi, Kasam, Parakh, Dhobi Doctor, Deewana, Darpan, Dr. Kumar, Maa, Khamosh, Nauka Doobi, Talaq, Zakhmi, Maharaja, Nirmala, Vilayati Babu, Dushman, Khandani, Puraskar, Tawaif, Asha, Aandhi, Sadma, Anaath, Loafer, Muqaddar, Prem Kahani, Vachan, Lahore to Calcutta, Navjeevan, Ramdhari B.A., Saudagar, Ghajini, Hero, Sawa Lakh, Pratima, Bulandi, Char Aankhen, Chanakya, Nakli Heera, Lahore, Rail Ka Dibba, Dost, Chhoti Si Duniya, Cinema and many more. ‚Äã While Himanshu Rai's original vision for a movie production house sowed the seeds for the formation of Indian cinema as an industry, Shri. Rajnarayan Dube single-handedly architected the business angle of the entire industry which was yet to come. He supported various new theatres such as BN Sircar‚Äôs New Theatres in Calcutta, V Shantaram‚Äôs Prabhat Pictures, Homi Wadia‚Äôs Wadia Movietone, Sohrab Modi‚Äôs Minerva Movietone, LV Prasad‚Äôs Prasad Labs and Pictures (Prasad was an ex-technician from Bombay Talkies), SS Vasan‚Äôs Gemini Pictures and Mehboob Khan‚Äôs theatres, Tarachand Barjatya‚Äôs Rajshri Productions (Barjatya served as a distribution manager for Bombay Talkies for the period of seven years), Sashadhar Mukherjee‚Äôs (Filmalaya Studio). Shri. Dube financed these fledgling companies and made them stronger. In essence, he builds the entire movie ecosystem in the country. Everyone whom Shri. Dube supported went to build a name for themselves in the industry. ‚Äã Shri. Rajnarayan Dube had a big vision for Indian Cinema. He wanted Indian film making to be a respectable profession. He thus stipulated that Bombay Talkies would only hire graduates. He hoped this move would legitimize the Indian film industry of the thirties and forties, and it certainly did. Besides this, Shri. Dube also wanted the Indian film industry to be inclusive of Indians from all states and sectors of life. Even though the movie company worked with European technicians, Shri. Dube would bring on Indian technicians and make sure that they learned the art of movie-making. He also brought a lot of Indian writers on-board so that movies could have an Indian cultural sensitivity and thus could appeal to a large number of people. This move gave rise to a whole new Indian profession, movie making! This seemed to be a good move in the light of circumstances that were yet to arrive. ‚Äã During one scene in the movie Karma, there was a minute-long kissing scene between Himanshu Rai & Devika Rani onscreen. During re-release, the film some extra controversial scenes were shot at that time for the sake of sensational purpose. This caused quite a stir in Indian society then Seth Badriprasad Dube's father of Shri. Rajnarayan Dube was furious about the scene. Himanshu Rai apologized and held his ears‚Äô and said that it would not happen again. After that incident, Shri. Dube however, resolved to screen all films by himself before they could be released. He was a Brahmin and a conservative and strictly discouraged smoking, drinking and other vices in the studio premises. He was also a very caring employer for those pioneering people who worked at Bombay Talkies. He made sure that Education, Rent, Food, and other daily necessities were provided free of cost to employees of Bombay Talkies. He also championed the rights of the movie industry by setting up Unions and Associations such as IMPPA (of which Bombay Talkies was the first member). He also helped grow the regional film industry. He staunchly supported Marathi, Hindi, Bengali, Assamese, Oriya, Gujarati and Southern cinema. If it wasn‚Äôt for Shri. Dube, the Indian movie industry would have resembled other Southeast Asian movie industries from Pakistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, and Nepal. Bollywood today is big enough to compete with Hollywood movies. ‚Äã During the Second World War, Bombay Talkies was struggling. The war had made things very difficult in many ways. The company had several movies on the floor but they could not get them finished because the crucial German technicians had been arrested and detained by the British Government. At this point, 15-20 films were on the production floor and were stalled pretty badly. Himanshu Rai suffered a nervous breakdown as a result of this and passed away in 1940. Bombay Talkies had just lost its crucial co-founder on whose vision the entire company stood to be successful. Shri. Rajnarayan Dube decided that Rai‚Äôs vision for Indian cinema would continue and he again invested four lakhs ten thousand rupees into the venture. This injected some much-needed blood into the company and a new era of Indian film making began. Shri. Dube decided that from that moment on, Bombay Talkies would only hire Indian technicians and production professionals. ‚Äã In this second phase, the company boomed and went on to a very productive cinematic run. 1943 hit Kismet was getting rave reviews everywhere and managed to run in theatres for 3 and half years in over 90% of the Indian theatres! By comparing the value of gold and land by today‚Äôs standards, the movie made the equivalent of Rs. 40000 crores. Not one movie has broken this record in terms of business. By 1954, Bombay Talkies had put its name to a huge amount of work. It had produced 115 films, had introduced over 280 new talents, built 400 theatres across the country. With the historical grand success of Bombay Talkies, the legendary film company under the influence of Rajnarayan Dube had now processed more than 450 films of outside and likeminded producers and made more than 250 film projects for the new and needy producers. As the success of Bombay Talkies was going sky-high the clash of ego between the giants also started roaring high? The three companies which solely belonged to Rajnarayan Dube, The Bombay Talkies Studios, Bombay Talkies Laboratories, and Bombay Talkies Pictures were doing fine but the fourth company The Bombay Talkies Limited, which was established by him to include more people and more talents was becoming a platform to project nasty ego clashes of the directors and management of the company. Instead of being devoted to film making and cinema they devoted their energy and talent for spreading rumors and objectionable stories. At this time Shri. Rajnarayan Dube decided that he and his company had arrived at the goal that they had set out to complete two decades earlier. Indian films were now a major force in terms of communication and entertainment in post-independence India. Shri. Dube shut down his sole proprietorship companies The Bombay Talkies Studios, Bombay Talkies Laboratories and Bombay Talkies Pictures in 1954 so that he could pay more attention to other aspects of his business and continued to distribute and finance in films. The fate of the limited company, The Bombay Talkies Limited, which was established to include more people and more talents, got entrapped in selfish motives and litigations. Since 1953, complicated legal battles are going on in different courts till date. Among all odds and misfortune, of the passed time Bombay Talkies became a dream only to be in memories, the artists and technicians, whom Bombay Talkies made living legends in their own lives, who became national and international personalities by virtue of their own right, became world-famous. But there was no one to take notice of Bombay Talkies. ‚Äã Many film-makers followed Rajnarayan Dube as a fortune for them, like Prakash Mehra, one of the legendary filmmakers of India who got the first chance to direct a movie named, Haseena Maan Jayegi, starred Shashi Kapoor. The film got stuck because of lack of budget. Later, popular actor Shashi Kapoor advised him to acquaint with Shri. Rajnarayan Dube; ""He is the person who will appreciate your talent and help you out from the issue"". Rajnarayan Dube said yes to him and the film got triumphed magnificently. The same incident happened with Prakash Mehra in the film Samadhi which was starred by Dharmendra. Rajnarayan Dube helped him and got a huge applaud. Because of such incidents, Prakash Mehra followed Rajnarayan Dube as a deity and he was always thankful to him. Then he gave, back to back hits like Zanjeer, Khoon Pasina, Hera Pheri with the help of Rajnarayan Dube.

Chemical engineering MTech is not at all good in IITs. As most of the students in MTech are from normal college. They don't have coding skills. So they are ruled out of coding jobs (Which very few companies allow them to sit). Also core jobs in chemical engineering is very few for MTech with very less package. Most of the students in old IITs chemical engineering and Civil engineering are struggling to find a good job. Either they go out unplaced or most of them join PhD in some other IITs just to remove unemployment for 5 years (Atleast they will be getting 35k stipend) and in this way they can fool their relatives for 5 years by saying ‚ÄúAbhi toh PhD kar rha/rhi Hun"".
