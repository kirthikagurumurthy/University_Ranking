As far as the branch you are asking for is concerned you can easily get the seat considering the previous year (2019) and even before,cutoff which is most likely to remain the same this year as I read a news stating that the State results have again not been that good i.e Like They usually before last year they got scores like 99,100,etc and they would usually easily get a cutoff around 197 and above which made it really difficult for CBSE students to compete against them as far as TNEA is concerned. But this is not the case since last year the state board has been correcting very strictly and in particular from this year they had undergone a huge change in syllabus which is well in advantage of CBSE students who can now very well compete against them as the difference in marks mainly cutoff has reduced drastically. So with this cutoff you can definitely get a seat in ACT campus and you can hopefully apply for CEG campus courses like ECE,IT,EEE etc.if interested as if your community as well is in favour you would be easily getting a seat here as well and even community favourism is not needed for IT or EEE because this has been more or less the cutoff for these two branches last year. But while applying I would say choose your branch preference carefully If you want to study in a best campus with maximum advantages and you are not concerned about the branch much then you should first apply for CEG campus branches and then MIT and then ACT So prioritise according to what you prefer because once you are alloted one of your top preference you cannot get a lower preference even if you want it . (You can only apply for getting an even higher preference if possible ) So kindly take much care before you give your priority list while counselling. Cheers! All the best!!!

Checking this is vital, as it speaks more about the university than the university does.Government/Private University: It is advised to compare the pros and cons of either type of university, with emphasis on the modus operandi of either type.Class Size: It is often said that having a smaller teacher to student ratio is a win-win for both teachers and students, so that is something you might want to look up at.Quality of Education/Faculty/Campus Resources: This is probably the most vital point of comparison. You would obviously want to look up for the quality of education, faculty, and campus resources offered before you invest four years of your time into any university.Social Life: Social life is something every college fresher looks up to. In the beginning, this might sound very petty, but it is those fests and events that help you socialize with more people and make new friends. Hence, one needs to analyze which institutes could provide you with a better social life.Tuition/Financial Aid/RoI: For what its worth, it is vital to compare and select institutes that might be feasible for you. Those with a more reasonable Return of Investment (RoI), which also provide adequate scholarships and waivers.Location: Being close to home is something every student longs for. Hence, you might want to check up which university is closer to you in terms of distance.Course Catalogue: Looking up the course catalog would help you develop an understanding as to know what you can expect to learn from an academic perspective.Wishing you luck, and if you have decided on joining, we look forward to welcoming you at Anna University!

The most efficient way to clear the exams and come out with flying colours is preparing effectively throughout the semester. Of course, it is not plausible by everyone and at all the time Here are few tips to clear semester exams in Anna University and earn good grades:- 1. The first and foremost method to score good grades in final exams is to have a good and decent internal marks. Internals are an excellent mark boosters for the end semester exams. It is advisable to have an internal of above 30 or 35 out of 50 to obtain good grades. 2. As far as engineering exams in Anna University are concerned, it is recommended to read the syllabus carefully and prioritize what you need to study and how much you exactly need to study to pass the course. 3. While preparing for end semester exams, revisit your assessment question papers as it serves as a better mode of preparation. Also refer to those questions asked in previous year semester exams and try preparing answers for those important questions. 4. Try attending classes regularly as most exams are based on what is covered in the class. So, skipping classes is never advisable. Teachers and Professors usually discuss what is likely to be on an exam during classes, so if you are not in the class, you can't get this crucial information. 5. Take notes and hints on the subject during regular class hours, as handwritten notes prove to be a saviour on the eve of exams. Even if you are not good at taking notes, try to get a hard or soft copy of neat handwritten notes of your friend or classmate and have it ready for preparation before the exam. 6. Taking part in a group study is an excellent opportunity in understanding course material for an exam. Also ensure you're actually studying and not socializing. 7. Apart from exam preparation, you have to ensure that you get enough rest on the day before exams. Eat nutritious food and stay hydrated. Take regular breaks and don't be anxious. 8. Even if you study limited portions, try to revise those topics well so that it will give you confidence to approach exam without fear. 9. In semester exams it is very important that you write the question number for every question you attend. Else it will not be evaluated. Try attempting every question in the paper and please don't omit any question as it may lead to losing marks. Approach the exam in a strategic or logical way by attending easy and well known questions first as it will boost your confidence. Make a tick mark against the questions you attended in the first page of your answer booklet without fail. 10. Ultimately, there's just no shortcut for learning the complete course before the day of exam. If you are on the night before exam and if you feel unprepared, don't panic. The above said plenty, useful and vital methods like handwritten notes, assignment and assessment question papers will help you fetch good grades.

If you're hoping to have everything laid out for you and have all the subject materials provided solely from an examination point of view, prepare to be a tad disappointed! On the other hand, if you're willing to grasp the fundamental concepts while supplementing the knowledge accrued from lectures with your own research, you're in for a treat. Professors here are mostly PhD holders, so there's no room for doubt regarding their wealth of knowledge in their area of expertise. All you have to do is exploit this resource to your advantage. While the basic framework and concepts of the subject will be explained lucidly in class, you're expected to develop beyond the peripheral material by referring to reference books, doing assignments, delivering presentations, submitting projects (depending on the stream you choose), etc. Any doubts you encounter during self-study can always be clarified with the faculty, they are more than willing to help, in fact, what better way to teach than let you understand what questions need answers? Only when you know what to ask, will you fully appreciate the actual theory of the subject. The best part of CEG is that the professors give you free rein to explore subjects in whichever way you please. There's no restriction pertaining to books to be followed or syllabus to be adhered to. They expect you to expand your understanding by utilizing the time to inculcate the habit of employing creative thought. After all, it wouldn't suffice to regurgitate facts that are well-known already! Wouldn't it be better to give you chance to branch out your critical thinking skills and provide you with a solid foundation that would allow for that to happen? While teaching can be a subjective experience, it's always reasonable to take a step beyond what's handled in the classroom and contribute to one's skillset by dedicated learning and self-study.

Most of the Central government schools like Kendriya Vidyalayas, Navodaya Vidyalayas, Army Public Schools and Air Force Schools fall under the purview of this board. Private schools like the DPS society schools follow this system too. CBSE also conducts JEE-Main currently and used to manage the AIPMT Exams until recently. Overall CBSE is a very decent choice as far as educational boards are concerned. Pros: · If your parents have a transferrable job then CBSE could be ideal for you as almost every city in India has a CBSE school. · CBSE gives you an edge as the syllabus is followed by most competitive exams like JEE, NEET, etc. · The syllabus has greater flexibility and is more student-friendly as compared to the State Boards. · The emphasis is on the overall growth of students with encouragement in sporting and extracurricular activities. · CBSE certificate is recognized throughout India. Cons: · The approach is more theoretical and not much emphasis is given to real-life concepts behind the science. · Fewer subjects when compared to ICSE. · The focus is mainly on Maths and Science and not much importance given to core English knowledge. · The student picks a stream in 11th & 12th i.e. Science, Commerce, Arts, etc. instead of individual subjects. Each state in India has its board of secondary education. These boards offer curricula to state schools and colleges with pre-university courses. The curriculum of the state board changes according to the state and thus is different in many aspects. There are a few state board colleges that are renowned for their good teaching staff and facilities provided. Pros: · Unique to every state in India. · Easier than other boards with an all-inclusive curriculum that accommodates students of all capabilities. · Ideal for students with other interests such as sports, as the workload is not much. · The curriculum allows you to score high and at the same time focus on extra classes to prepare for entrance exams like JEE. Cons: · The syllabus is not comprehensive enough as compared to other boards. · Traditionally has been more of rote learning. · State language could be mandatory although it varies from state to state. To conclude, the board that you choose doesn’t matter if you can study properly, work hard and score good marks. If your goal is to join ANNA UNIVERSITY colleges or any other institution affiliated to it then my advice is that you should get into a STATE BOARD school since students from there have been known to score higher cutoff marks compared to the CBSE applicants. This increases your chances of securing a seat in a good college with a good branch. Thank You. If you find this answer to be useful then please do UPVOTE!!!

But go for it only if you can manage both your development and studies and only if your Handwriting is good. Assuming your Presentation skills and handwriting is good then I suggest you start exam preparations 1 month before each semester. First, cover all previous year questions of the last 10 years. then look up your syllabus and complete leftover topics. Finally, revise 2–3 times the whole syllabus and you are set. Do this for all 36 papers and you will succeed. ",0.030195454545454546,Neutral,3.060390909090909,0.03225806451612903,1,4.060390909090909

Try to read aloud if you are an auditory learner or write notes if that’s what helps you learn effectively. Use mnemonics, flashcards, flow charts, etc to reinforce what you have already studied. If you have poor memory, and if revising 2-3 times works, schedule your study plans to accommodate the same. Try to group study for certain subjects that may help. Don’t be afraid to ask for help when required. There is no all-encompassing formula or secret that would give you the 1st rank easily.

But as far as I hear now, these fests would be under control of professors from now on, so I do not know how things are going there.Seniors are chilled and no one needs to be called with suffix “sir.” Everyone calls their seniors like Anna or Akka. There is a humble relationship between seniors and juniors. This helps you to get guidance in all areas.You need not worry about placements, provided you are from circuit branches. On the other hand, the non-circuit branch students will have to struggle but the hard workers usually get placed with flying colors.Being a deemed university, your examination question papers will mostly be set by your faculty. So you will get to know some important topics :PThe students generally come from humble and hardworking backgrounds, it is not at all a tough task to find good friends.Cons:- Well, there is a dress code. Not so strict, but you must wear full pants and shirts for men. Casual wear will also work. Salwar suits for women. Fancy suits will also work.You may have to get settled for a not so important but scoring subject as an elective rather than the one in which you were most interested about. This is because you get so few options for the electives because of less faculty.This one is only for Other State Candidates: You may have to struggle a little bit with the language, but give it 4 to 6 months, you will become so fluent in Tamil that an outsider cannot state the difference between you and a local guy.Finally, getting to the second part of your question, since it is a deemed university, sometimes it happens that the lecturer does not complete the syllabus. This may put extra pressure while placements that you have to study extra or for those who want to do masters. But there are fewer cases of such things happening. This also may happen because the teacher teaches so well but slow that the time runs up. You can always get to the cabin of the faculty to ask doubts, they would be happy to help you. I hope my answer helps. Have a happy stay at CEG. ",0.18337499999999998,Positive,3.36675,0.03225806451612903,1,4.36675

Welcome to SRM University. You will be paying only 20 times what you pay at Anna University. If you hard working and wish to come up in life Choose Anna University.  To save you some time, here’s the shortest answer. SRM University. It Sucks. Don’t think of joining here. Join any local/nearby state college, you’ll feel much more contended. Now a long, justified answer, for those having a doubt over my opinion. I am a student of final year, currently pursuing B.Tech from this University. I will trace back my journey from final year, and then leave it up to decide. Back during the joining and counselling time, when I came to Chennai for the first time, I was awestruck by the huge buildings of the campus. I am from a small town, and all these attracted me very quickly. During the counselling, we were made to run from one building of the campus to another building. I was wondering why didn’t they put up the whole admission shit at one place. Poor management has been the college’s forte from a long time I guess. Anyway, this was my first day’s experience of the college. The hostel life was no good. There were some lame rules regarding the wifi, like, it would start functioning only after 6p.m., and only upto 7a.m. I was like “WHAT???!!!”…who does that, they were charging us nearly one lacs for our hostel, and couldn’t even provide wifi for 24 hours. Like this was not enough, all the social networking apps were banned (WhatsApp, Facebook, Instagram, Hike, Viber (Calling App). Still, we managed to use VPNs to access the apps, but the speed was so shitty, that even 1G (had it ever existed) would have worked better than the wifi. Mess food should not even be discussed I guess; we all know what shit they provide at the mess, at every hostel in the country. Coming to academics. The college had one of the shittiest rules anyone might have had ever heard-collared t-shirts/shirts, jeans and shoes are mandatory. One question to the low standard management of the college, WHY? What makes you think that this will bring discipline to the college? One advice, increase the education quality, don’t make some futile rules, nobody respects you all anyway. The faculties are a lot more degraded. They study from this college, and then teach in this college. This tells you how uneducated they are. We were provided books by college for the first 2 years. Most of the boosk were written and published by the faculties of the college itself. Now imagine-studying from SRM, teaching in SRM, then providing the books to the students written by the teachers of SRM. A nursery grade kid could write a better English than these people, kudos to the education of these faculties (or as they would like to call themselves, “PROFESSORS”). The evaluation system was horrible during our time. This is the break-up of the internal marks Cycle Tests (CT) 1 - 10 marks CT 2 - 10 marks Model Exam - 20 marks Surprise Test (Which we knew about a week before, always) - 5 marks Attendance (Yes, trust me!!!) - 5 marks Aaaaand then we had our end sem exam, which had a weight age of 50 marks. So basically, all we had done during our 4 years, is given exams, every damn month. Labs have never been more useless than here. First, we have to make an ‘observation notebook’. Then, we have to copy the exact same thing in a ‘record file’. In Chandler’s way - “Could anything be more useless?” And it doesn’t end here. After writing the record, you have to get the signature of the Lab In charge (who will make you run behind him like you’re his pet), then the HOD (who doesn’t even care to look what’s inside the file), then a stamp from the department office. And what will they do after all this in the University Practical Exam? Punch a hole in the file and give it back to you. You will suddenly have this irresistible urge of ripping the faculty’s body apart and shredding him/her into pieces and feeding it to the stray dogs. Don’t even think of arguing with the faculties. They will make sure that you don’t pass the semester, and will always find an excuse to kick you out of the class, like you’ve been trying sell his both the kidneys (although eventually you’ll wish to do this :D :P ). Once they will find you in some wrong-doing, they will not leave any stone un turned to serve vengeance. The teaching methodology is like something from the medieval period. They will teach you in the dumbest way possible, making the topic all the more obscure, in such a way that the concept will float in front of your eyes in the most haphazard manner. Many seminars, talks, sessions took place in our college. We were forced to attend those, as the faculties had the bait of attendance. They always said that we have to compulsorily attend the seminar, as attendance will be taken there. We knew that nothing as such would happen, still we always fell into this trap, I don’t know why. You all must have heard of the saying - All that glitters is not gold. This fits perfectly for our ‘Fests’. The more they boasted of it to be a grand event, the more hollow it turned out every time. It’s a humble request - don’t ever think of attending the fests. Instead, utilize the 4–5 days’ holiday and just go to any hill-station nearby (there’re many-Coorg, Munnar, Kodaikanal, Ooty are a few to be named). They could’t even welcome John Abraham properly; he was addressed as a “model, and a bollywood actor”. Shame on you, SRM!!! Skipping the sophomore and the 3rd year, jumping straight to the final year, because the nonsense followed suit. This is when you’ll realize how low this college could sink to create a fake impression in front of companies. Infosys was called for a seminar, which the college tagged as ‘pre-placement talk’. And the company came after almost about a month, for the actual placement process. This was done just to make the company feel that the students are interested in their placements. I am from a non CS/IT/Software branch. So obviously I didn’t know anything about coding. We were made to sit forcefully for TCS recruitment process, and were threatened of being removed from the placements if we didn’t attend their training session. Here’s a screenshot of the mail sent by a faculty of mechanical engineeringbranch to its faculties. You can see what kind of sorcery they were doing for us, in the name of ‘helping the students in the placement process’  Now the mail which was sent to us  This was almost a kind of blackmailing. We had no choice but to sit for the placement. And above that, we were made to learn C programming language in 2 days, with a lecture of 2 hours a day. What on earth made them think it was ever possible? So basically, the faculties were deciding in which company we were supposed to sit. Never even my parents had done this, who are they (faculties) to take decision on this subject? Now this is all one person’s view, which is subjective, let’s go in an objective way. Here are some stats. Prices are not constant Tuition Fees - 2 lacs Books Fees - 15 thousand, which just included 6–7 third class quality books, and a drafter and a cheap geometry box, which broke in the first 2 months of usage. We didn’t get the drafter and the geometry box in the 2nd year. CDC Fees - Another 15 thousand, which included only 2 books of Quantitative Aptitude and 1 book on Verbal Aptitude Hostel And Mess Fees - Approximately 98 thousand. A room which was meant for 2 people previously had started accommodating 3 people Laundry Fees - 5/6 thousand (can’t remember it exactly). It was also compulsory, and we were not allowed to give more that 14 clothes in a week, which included only 1 bed sheet. If clothes were extremely, dirty, they would return them without even washing. Many a times clothes were misplaced. Examination Fees - Approximately 2.3 thousand. This is to be paid before every semester exam. Now the hefty fines. ID Card Lost - 1500. By making a DD, they won’t even accept cash. Renewal of ID Card - 1000. Same process Exam Admit Card Lost - 760 If caught cheating/malpractice in the end semester - 10 thousand. All the papers will be cancelled. So to all those people out there, thinking of joining the “Number 1 Private University In India”, please save your parents’ hard earned money, and join any other, I repeat, ANY OTHER COLLEGE IN INDIA, BUT NOT SRM UNIVERSITY.

I do not have any personal preference for any college nor I suggest you to join these colleges. These colleges are based on Student’s choice for 2018 based on Cut-off of above 180 Marks in Maths/Physics/Chemistry for OC - CSE Branch which is highly sought for. Please ensure that the results are not 100% fool-proof and before joining any college, Please visit the college in person, look at the Infrastructure/Facilities, enquire about the Faculties and their pedagogue along with general life for students. Please DO NOT join strict colleges as well as stupid colleges where they have TALIBAN rules enforced where boys cannot talk to girls et al as FREEDOM to Pursue your DREAM in learning with enjoyment along with responsibility should be your primary Motto!! Hope you all are doing fine. I am 49 year old Director of an IT Company and have done B.Tech and MBA from Top 10 Institute (Govt) from 1987 to 1991. Based on my background in Engineering, I just visited TNEA counselling website at https://tneaonline.in/TNEACutoff.html to understand what was the Cut-off for 2018 for various colleges along with branches and did a thorough research of the top 50 Institutes that come under Anna University Counselling which covers all 550 colleges comprising of Government, Govt-Aided and Reputed Private colleges. The criteria which I used is based on 2018 Cut-Off (Last Mark of MPC above 180/200) of CSE (which is highly sorted branch and has got maximum cut-off of where students compete) and have taken only Anna University Affiliated Colleges which directly comes under Anna University as well as Anna University AUTONOMOUS College where the College conduct exams but the final degree will be awarded by Anna University. I have excluded National Reputed Institutes like IIT, NIT, IIITDM and so called DEEMED (Read Fraud:-)) Universities as they don’t come under TNEA authorisations. Based on the above criteria, I am rating the Top 50 colleges where students exercised their choice in 2018. The Good News is that for this year 2019, the Cut-offs for OC will certainly reduce by at least 5% and for other categories such as BC/MBC/SC/ST, the cut off will reduce by 7% to 30% due to change in Exam Pattern as well as tough correction along with NO BLUEPRINTS:-).

CEG has better recognition. SSN also has an active alumni association and tie ups with Carnegie Mellon University, but since it's a relatively new college, it is not as well known as CEG. So, if you wish to go for the brand name, recognition and want to make use of the plethora of opportunities, CEG is definitely a better idea. Since I'm not sure about the civil department placements in core companies in both colleges, I feel it's safer to go with a better recognised college, so that your future academic interests aren't hampered. In a job searching scenario too, CEG students will be preferred more, is what I feel. It's up to you to decide, as both are really good colleges with their own pros and cons. All round development comes only through self effort and the college is just a place where opportunities are given for putting in that effort. SSN is definitely a good college in all aspects, I can proudly say that, as I've been here for a year and I've more or less experienced the SSN life to an extent, where I can safely comment about it.

True. There may be some irregularities and corruption associated with any project or scheme. But due to that reason discontinuing the scheme altogether with a promise to re continue the same scheme with a different name is utter foolishness. The scheme to provide meals to poor at the rate of RS.5 has become popular in Andhra Pradesh. Mostly poor persons are utilizing the services of those Canteens. The canteens are situated in places where most of the poor do their work and offer mid-day meals at a reasonable rate of Rs.5. But it is sad to note that the scheme is discontinuing effect from 1st. August 2019. {The Andhra Pradesh government has closed the Anna canteens, which provide meals at Rs 5 for the poor and middle-class people, due to non-renewal of its contract with the Akshaya Patra Foundation. Last year, the state government under N Chandrababu Naidu had launched around 300 Anna canteens after the name of Telugu Desam Party (TDP) founder and former chief minister Nandamuri Taraka Ramarao (NTR). After coming to power, the YSRCP government decided in principle to change the name to Rajanna canteens after the late Rajasekhara Reddy. However, the movement currently stands on hold as the agreement with existing food supplying agency expired on July 31, 2019. The YSRCP government has either done away with or renamed many schemes implemented during the TDP rule. All the schemes announced by the new government during the last two months have been named after Chief Minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy's father and former chief minister YS Rajasekhar Reddy. Minister for Municipal Affairs Botsa Satyanarayana has said that the closure is temporary and the government will renew the contract agreement with the agency soon.

Let’s break it down:- The new regulations have brought in a new practice for revaluation, and the usual shroud of mystery has been lifted off this process, also allowing us to actually witness the revaluation. First you are supposed to apply for a photocopy of your paper for the subjects you want to review. Each photocopy costs ₹300.Next, you’ll receive your photocopies at the ACOE or DCOE offices respectively.After you have reviewed your paper thoroughly, you can apply for revaluation.A committee(consisting of your subject teacher, and a subject expert, and maybe more opinions), will sit down to discuss your paper in your presence! You get to lay claim for your marks in front of them and they can argue against your claim and there is equal chances for you to gain or lose your marks, depending on the answer you have written versus what was in the expected answer key.But if you review the photocopies and realise there is no exact scope for extra marks or there is no genuine mistakes in the correction, PLEASE DON’T APPLY FOR REVAL. Not only will you be paying an extra ₹200 per subject for the revaluation process, you will have to personally present your case in front of a Committee, and be able to prove your claim for those marks! There is the additional fact that the marks can be changed by + or - 15 only, which means the review could go either ways!! Also, these reviews could take place at any times… and may even hamper other aspects like for example; one of the students’ had her revaluation on the day of her assessment which increased her anxiety for both unnecessarily because the revaluation did not yield in any change in her marks in that subject. Sincere advice: it’s not worth it. Paying ₹500 to wait anxiously for an hour or two until you are summoned by the “committee” consisting of your teacher from the previous semester who would definitely be displeased at his/her correction being questioned, along with another teacher who is more inclined to be biased towards the teacher than to be unbiased, and of course, the obvious problem, not actually being able to get more marks that actually benefit your grade overall… Not worth it. Of course there are exceptions; especially when that one or two marks you stake claim for may actually end up boosting your overall grade in the subject, which is pretty rare by the way, but if that’s the case, then proceed, but with extreme caution.

631,631,Anna-University-Tamil-Nadu-India,How has the Choice-Based Credit System (CBCS) impacted Anna University?,2,1,2/1,No,Followed,2019-07-10,https://www.quora.com/How-has-the-Choice-Based-Credit-System-CBCS-impacted-Anna-University,"To those who are not familiar with the term, CBCS was a new regulation introduced by Anna University in its 4 main branches in 2015. It has its own sets of pros and cons. For a change, let's look at the cons first. Cons : One of the main motives of CBCS was to let students choose a staff as per their wishes with an overview that every student gets the faculty that they want. However, the procedure adopted for the same is as messy as IRCTC's ticketing portal, if not worse. Poorly maintained servers and frequent crashing have made the students to sit in front of their computers for hours, or even days, just to select a staff's name and click on Add.Students in rural areas face problems as the internet speed is still not appreciable in few areas. While the university can't be completely blamed for the aforementioned reason, it can at least postpone the enrolment on the reopening day, so that the students can avail the facilities present inside the college's computer laboratories.CBCS started off as a cakewalk for students due to relative grading. The pass mark was 60 percentage of the class average. This meant that, aggregate marks of even 20–30 passed the subject. And then, in the middle of a semester, the University suddenly set 50 as the minimum pass mark to clear the subject. The primary reason for bringing in relative grading was to reduce the burden and workload of the students. But, due to the minimum pass mark amendment, it's primary cause has only been reversed. Before the amendment, there were less than 10 students with arrears in my department. After that, more than 60 students had backlogs. This was just very extreme and the time to adapt was too short.I'm not vouching for bringing in the old system, but the AU can emulate the IIT's and NIT's, where the pass mark is either half of the class highest mark or the class average (the lesser mark is taken into consideration). I'm not entirely sure of the last line but this is what I've heard so. Please feel free to correct me if I'm wrong.Before CBCS, the staffs were assigned on the basis of batches by the department. In this case, the distribution of staffs was completely normal ie) no batch was overdosed with lenient staffs or strict staffs. But, in the new system, if you're just 2 minutes late, you might end up getting all 6 staffs as strict staffs. With the server being unreliable, this issue has happened a lot. My motive is not to criticise a staff who is strict, because everyone evaluates in their own way. But, I've personally seen students put the same effort as others and still end up getting a lesser GPA by 0.75 or 1 than students who are equally capable, because most of their staffs were strict in awarding marks. My point is to make the distribution more normalised.Pros : Your timetable can be flexible as per your interests. CBCS certainly offers its own fair share of freedom to the students, as they can get to decide their timetable.It allows students to gel with their department mates, as the classes are constantly shuffled.It is much more easier to select professional and open elective courses using the server, rather than doing it manually.One final point I'd like to say from my heart is, CBCS has brought too much shuffling and changing in between classes. There's a lack of a constant bunch of people surrounding each other, due to the constant shuffling. This has created a dearth in the class room atmosphere that we used to be pride about in our school days. Ever remembered how you used to shout “12 C is the best?”. Sadly, that doesn't happen here. While CBCS does encourage getting to know more people, my opinion is that having a constant bunch of people around you means a greater deal than the former. Thank you. Hope you took this post in the right way! :) ",0.13389062499999999,Positive,3.26778125,0.06451612903225806,1,4.2677812500000005

In 1858 it became the Civil Engineering School and the College of Engineering in 1861.Topping was also the first full-time modern professional surveyor of India having surveyed the seas off the Coromandel Coast, India’s south-east coast. Topping persuaded astronomer William Petrie to gift his equipment to the government and set up the first modern astronomical observatory in Nungambakkam. The school was established in 1792 and Topping was appointed as the British East India Company’s astronomer. Topping died in 1796. CEG began its journey as a school of survey established by the East India Company in 1794 at the Fort St.George Madras. There were only 8 students to start with. It was started by the initiation of Michael Topping an Astronomical Surveyor. He was succeeded by John Golding Ham, who was an Architect and Marine Surveyor. The name of the survey school was changed as Civil Engineering School and moved to Kalasa Mahal buildings in Chepauk in the year 1858. The scope was to train upper and lower subordinates. The College was affiliated to the Madras University in 1862. Civil Engineering was the specialty in those early days. The first set of the students received the DCE degree in 1864. In 1920 the College moved into the sprawling 185 acres campus at Guindy. In 1925, Rao Bahadur G. Nagarathinam Ayyar became the first Indian Principal of the College. This institution became the oldest technical institution in Asia and has several first to its credit.Shifting of the college to Guindy was the impact of conducting the Degree courses in Mechanical Engineering and paved the way for rapid expansion to add some more Degree courses. The Degree courses thus added into curriculum are: Mechanical Engineering – 1894Electrical Engineering – 1930Telecommunication and High ways – 1945Printing Technology 1982 Research Programs were introduced in 1935. Dr. K. L. Rao, former Union Minister for irrigation obtained his first M.Sc. Degree by Research. Miss. Leela George and Miss. A. Lalitha were the first two lady Engineers of Guindy.(1940). In 1942-43, accelerated course was brought into effect with no vacations and 3 batches passed out in two years because of World War II. In 1946 First Ph.D. was obtained by Prof.K.Sukumaran. In 1947 two more colleges were started, one at Ananthapur and another at Vishakhapatnam. But they functioned at Guindy itself for some time for want of infra structural facilities at the new places. In 1957 the intake of students was increased from 175 to 275 for the College. Pre professional course was introduced and the entry level was the newly started Pre-University course. This was later changed to 5 year integrated course. I entered the college in 1957 for the pre professional course and later took Electrical Engineering and passed out in 1962. There were only three branches for us, Electrical, Civil and Mechanical. The branches were selected only in the third year and for the first two years we had to undergo common subjects. There were 2 Girl students in our batch and both took civil Engineering. For the first time one of our batch mate entered into Indian Administrative Service (I.A.S) and another into Indian Foreign Service (I.F.S.) In 1962, due to the Chinese Aggression, many of our batch mates joined the Army Services. Due to rapid industrialization, there were job ample opportunities both in private and Government sectors. We were fortunate to choose the job to our liking. Many of our batch mates went to other countries to seek jobs with higher salaries and perks. All settled well in high positions in life. CEG became the number one college in the State and the Engineering course attracted the best brains of youngsters. CEG was flourishing in Academics, Sports and self employment. Our Engineers had the Ability to design a system, component, or process to meet desired needs within realistic constraints such as economic, environmental, social, political, ethical, health and safety, manufacturability and sustainability. They were also able to function on multidisciplinary teams. In short they become the back bone of our country’s development. In 1978 Perarignar Anna University of Technology (PAUT), subsequently the Anna University, was established with four constituent colleges, 1.CEG 2. MIT 3.ACTech and 4. S.A.P. The Anna University functioned from the Guindy Campus. Mr. P. Sivlingam was the first Vice Chancellor. Dr.Kulandaisamy took over as the second Vice Chancellor and Dr. M.Anandakrishnan was the third Vice Chancellor of the University. New branches of Engineering were introduced in the College. The College offers number of UG and PG courses in different disciplines. The intake was increased every year and it is around 2700 Full time and 550 Part- time UG students as of now and for the PG courses 1740 full time and 453 part time students. In January 2001, all Engineering Colleges in Tamilnadu were affiliated to Anna University. As one of the oldest engineering institutions in the country, CEG has a rich tradition of research, and is dedicated to furthering the frontiers of technology and engineering. Around 13,000 research scholars, pursuing their Ph.D. and M.S./M.Tech at CEG, are afforded a range of opportunities to explore their fields, under the guidance of over 2500 top researchers, and with access to state­ of­ the ­art infrastructure. Often called upon by the Tamil Nadu and Indian government for research purposes, students will work towards sustainable solutions to real world problems. One of the many achievements brought about by the diligence of CEG’s research body, is the launch of the indigenously built microsatellite, ANUSAT, the first such satellite to be built by an Indian university. Under the aegis of ISRO, students and faculty worked tirelessly to build, launch and operate the satellite. CEG is hence the nexus of technology and some of the brightest minds of the country, truly encouraging to an atmosphere of progressive research. CEG engages the research scholars in extensive research activities that extend beyond classrooms. Various specialized Research Centres, with highly experienced faculty, are located around the campus that provides facilities to undertake research in any chosen sphere. Apart from prioritized academic focus, research centres are integral to the comprehensive knowledge, CEG aims to provide. The number of Ph.D. awardees of Anna University from the inception (1978-2013) is 4028, while in the last six convocations (2008-2013) the figure touched, 2793 and in the convocation held in 2013 alone, it is 690. In the 35th convocation, 1010 Ph.D. scholars are awarded degrees. This is an “All time High” number of Ph.D. awardees (for a calendar year) in convocation for Anna University and the highest number of Ph.D. awardees ever achieved by any other Technical University in India. College of Engineering Guindy emerged as the top most college in the State and only the top ranking students are able to get admissions in the College. True to its credit, it has secured the 8th ranking for Engineering and 13th for overall as ranked by National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF).The number of private colleges affiliated to Anna University was increased to 590 and the intake of the engineers in 2017 year is about 2 LAKHS .  CEG was established in May of 1794, as a School of Survey with one student in a building near Fort St. George. Founded by Michael Topping, the school became the Civil Engineering School in 1858. Subsequently, CEG was established as a college in 1859 under the Madras University. It was then rechristened as College of Engineering in 1861 with the inclusion of the Mechanical Engineering course.

Ten academicians, including the former Controller of Examinations Prof. G.V. Uma, were named as accused in the scandal involving a large number of students who allegedly paid bribes to boost their scores during the revaluation of answer scripts. The agency conducted a surprise check on the premises of the suspects and seized incriminating documents, including copies of answer scripts as well as property documents. This is the second time that an incident of this nature has been recorded in Anna University; the last one coming in June 2012. In June 2012, two faculty members had given in writing that they were pressured by some top university officials to award higher marks to certain students during revaluation. However, the accused in that case, who were initially suspended from service, had subsequently gone scot-free due to lack of conclusive evidence. In the latest instance, the First Information Report said in April/May 2017, Dr. Uma, presently Professor, Department of Information Science and Technology, Anna University, conspired with Dr. P. Vijayakumar, Assistant Professor/Dean (in-charge), University College of Engineering, Tindivanam, and Dr. R. Sivakumar, Assistant Professor, University College of Engineering, Tindivanam, and demanded ₹10,000 from each student to boost marks during the revaluation process. Marks forged The suspects allegedly forged answer scripts by altering the marks to benefit the students who paid bribes. The accused persons “destroyed a maximum number of the answer scripts of the students for whom they awarded enhanced marks/pass marks in the revaluation done during August 2017 at Tindivanam and thereby caused disappearance of evidence relating to the criminal offence committed by them.” Preliminary investigation revealed that of the 3,02,380 students who applied for revaluation, 73,733 passed and as many as 16,636 got enhanced marks. Dr. Uma served as Controller of Examinations of Anna University during 2015-18. Dr. Vijayakumar and Dr. Sivakumar were zonal coordinators for the valuation centre at Tindivanam. The remaining accused — R. Sundarajan, M. Mahesh Babu, N. Anbuselvan, C.N. Pratheeba, I. Pragadheeswarar, M. Rameshkannan and S. Ramesh — were professors/lecturers during the same period. “We suspect that several thousands of engineering students paid bribes to boost their scores. Many of them would have graduated as engineers from Anna University. During searches, we seized copies of answer scripts and documents of immovable assets from the residential and office premises of Dr. Uma and others. The accused have been booked under the provisions of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988, and also on charges of conspiracy, cheating, forgery and criminal misconduct,” a senior DVAC officer. Evidence destroyed According to the DVAC, the accused destroyed a large number of answer scripts without following the due procedures in a bid to eliminate evidence. However, dozens of answer scripts that were seized clearly revealed the nature of the offence. “If, during the first revaluation, a student gets marks which are 15% more than the original score, the answer script is referred to a third examiner...It is here that the offence took place. Higher marks were awarded to students by forging the answer scripts that were destroyed. Teachers who refused to cooperate and insisted on awarding actual marks were debarred from the process of valuation,” the officer said. When investigators conducted a check by referring some seized answer scripts to independent examiners, it was found that the marks awarded were disproportionately high. During a discreet enquiry prior to registering the case, investigators gathered adequate evidence to prove that students paid bribes to get enhanced marks. The corruption angle was substantiated with other material evidence besides statements of some examiners who admitted to pressure from the suspected officials to commit the offence, sources in the agency added. Investigation was on to examine students, examiners and all others involved in the process of revaluation in the last academic year. Since there was a procedure to get the concurrence of the Passing Board to treat the revaluation marks as equivalent to the original marks obtained by the student and also to recommend action against examiners who were found guilty, the DVAC officials were trying to check if any such complaint was reported to the university authorities and any action contemplated against the examiners or their superiors.

They can't even scold them as teenagers will get into wrong hands. Self study and maturity happens to the students mostly in that 4 years college life,but they try to choose the other path. Passed out students with few arrears will say that college has no infrastructure, no good faculties. But parents will never think that while others can get good marks why not their son/daughter in the same college or campus. So to give good life to their children parents choose the worst path to buy certificates through money. As human society is a power monger and money monger society. This scam is running. The start of this scam is due to the disability of the students and the ability of the powerful parent's. Thank you!!!

Hence, you have the option of starting fresh and learning some basics on your own before you head to college. Head over here- A Gentler Introduction to Programming – freeCodeCamp and start having fun.The faculty at CEG are not going to make learning enjoyable for you. This sucks, but it’s true. So don’t count on learning in the classroom alone. If you’re lucky you might get a few good faculty who understand and teach the curriculum, but that’s not the majority situation.What you study in the classroom and what will help you get a job aren’t always highly correlated, so start cultivating the habit of learning outside the classroom. Places like Codeforces might be helpful.In addition to the points above, don’t get intimidated. Never feel like you’re worse than others out there just because they have a small headstart.

I have had quite a few experiences that I’d love to share from my three years in Madras Institute of Technology, Chennai. There are two aspects of learning - social and academical. The elaboration of each section makes the answer a bit longer than expected. Social Part: I have learnt a lot of things by studying at Madras Institute of technology - from office politics to social relations, from project completion vows to wordly explanation, from friends to acquaintances, from girlfriends to crushes! The social part of my life has become a complete package because of this college. This college provides you the freedom to experiment. Yes, that’s right. Classes will not be completely from 8.30 AM to 4.30 PM. There will be a lot of free time available for you to hang out with your friends, irrespective of the gender. You can try different hotels, movies, involve in a lot of cultural activities, organize events, walk around the park etc. In short, you can explore a lot in and around college. Except, of course if you can get above 65% attendance, you can get away with it. Co-curricular ActivitiesYou can experiment new ideas with your friends in team projects like Baja, Supra and other stuff which can improve your team management skills and leadership. This allows you to understand how your fellow mates are there with you when you are in difficult situations (I really mean it!). When you are involved in a competition, people who showed promising faces earlier will back away and panic monster sets in. That's when you realize who the genuine people you call friends are and I have found a few (I’ll hold them close to me). Peer to Peer relationship, stress management and even more come into picture and mould you into a forward thinker who knows what to expect from life and plan accordingly. InternshipsBeing a student of the prestigious college makes you eligible for a wide variety of internship and from personal experience, internship is bit overrated during college life. I know it is important to taste work life but if you can't learn anything from it, that is unnecessary and it happens most of the times. At one point, the memories you make going through these internships will be more valuable than the internship itself. Extra-curricular activitiesEvery first year has to go through the toughest physical test of his life in the name of NCC, YRC or NSO. I have experienced a hell of an experience during the summer camp of NSO. Our football coach who accompanied us showed me how ruthless life could be. But he also taught me the greatest lesson of anyone’s life: “Explore your limits”. He used to make us run almost 15 km in the morning including warm-up sessions which also involved running(I have never run more than 200m ever in my life). He sculpted us into footballers in just 10 days. After that, jogging seemed like nothing to us. Team ActivitiesEveryone obviously has dreams that inspire them. I too had one. To achieve it, I needed some time to prepare and this is where the toppers come in. They are just selfless people who gave away weeks of work for me just to edit the calculations and procedure and produce the required work just before the deadline. I will never have enough words to thank them. Without them my dreams of getting into something big would have been shattered by now. Academic Part: The one you guys have been eagerly waiting for. I’m afraid this is going to be a bit disappointing. CurriculumIt is a 10-year-old syllabus which is of no use in the world outside the college campus. I have learnt it the hard way around. It is a potential killer of time and the best way to navigate through this was reading books. I had read my way through them. And MIT OCW lectures were the real deal. FacultyI was a firm believer that good colleges had good faculties. But I was fazed with reality that faculty were not well-versed even in their own principles. I have even thought “what would happen if I took the notes they dearly carried, away from them?”, “Would they be able to continue?” They can’t even elaborate on the notes they prepared. Whenever confronted with good intriguing questions, the answers will be “Ask me later”, “We will see in the next class” (which had never been done) and worst of all is “This question that you are asking doesn’t belong to the engineering domain at all!” These answers had left me bewildered. But, reality is harsh. ProjectsThe Academics that I have faced never left me with challenges. People here will make you believe that doing a quadcopter is a life time achievement. A myth which was busted from my field experience in the competitions I attended. I came to know that some companies were selling it like toys which made me realize how absurd I was. Because, we have never even designed a Paper plane of our own. Quadcopter is something beyond. It is also worthy to mention that we have had professors who had their hands in putting ANUSAT in orbit, but quality has deteriorated quite drastically. Finally!! The Dream BrokenI am an engineering aspirant who had come with dreams of engineering my way into the real world. The only thing I was allowed to do was pass with distinction. “Never ask questions”, “Don't do anything new”, “Don't study from google because it is out of syllabus that everyone follows”. To say that all these just made my passion succumb to death is an understatement. The sad reality is that I still aspire to be an engineer even after completing 3 years of engineering. Note: Contents may hurt a few. I had been brutally honest. These are all objectively viewed experiences and shall not be taken personal.

Since you have only 20 backlogs till your 6th sem You need not to worry at all. If you wanna clear all your papers before the final (8th) semester, you need to put a little bit of effort. Find out the backlog subjects in which you have a decent internal marks (>=13) and work on those subjects. List out your backlogs and tabulate all the difficult and easy subjects, as per your knowledge. Schedule your time for doing things other than reading because during the rest of the time you should only prepare for your univ written exams. Concentrate more on maths and the subjects totally based on programming because this step will be really helpful forever even when you try for your job. Yes, Engineering maths is a little bit difficult to grasp within a short period of time but you can manage to get a minimum mark to clear all maths papers. YouTube has many study materials for engineering maths, please visit nptelhrd and download the necessary videos and watch it again and again until you get a clear understanding. When coming to the programming based subjects I would recommend the same (nptelhrd), but you can also manage to clear without the aid of nptelhrd if you know some basics of programming. You can also clear without programs but it depends upon how complicated the questions are. Download all the previous sem question papers and write down the part A and part B questions in a seperate notebook (please don't ignore it is worthy and you can refer it during the final sem if needed). Find the repeatedly asked questions and go through it often. Try to score fullmarks in part A atleast 8. Make sure a minimum of three questions in part B will score 10 marks each. Write something related to the question in part C(if you have one). Disable unnecessary apps in your phone till your exam. No social media apps, no games, no chit cagts and no outings. A minimum of 3 to 4 hours preparation is mandatory. Take a break for 2 to 5 minutes when you feel distracted. Quit the idea of group studies( it does not work out when coming to your scenario) during the time of examination. Get help from seniors who cleared the papers after several attempts because they know the key element. You can clear all your easy papers very easily and few difficult papers for sure within the 7 th sem. May be all the papers if you desired to follow this instructions strictly. Make sure you are scoring the matching external marks in univ written exam as per your existing internal marks. The following table has the list where you can get some idea.  Never ever skip any exam you may have chances to clear some papers by luck if God besides you. If you find any difficulties to appear for all the papers due to lack of time for preparation and revising or very low internal marks, give a try for difficult subjects and push your best. If not, kindly wait till the internal mark drops. Because When you have internal marks in single digit, you need to score more in univ written exam which you can see from the above table. There is another criteria like valuation without internal marks which is described in the following answers. Kindly go through it. In Anna University examinations regulation 2013, what is the minimum marks to get pass without internal after 3 attempts? Kindly upvote and share if you find this answer is useful.

More than 2500 teaching staffs/experts are recognized as supervisors by the Centre for guiding research scholars. Details required for the scholars/supervisors are posted in the website and periodically updated. Helpdesk is available for scholars to express their problems /to clarify any doubts. Centre is focusing fully on e-Governance such as Online submission of application for Ph.D./M.S. programmes, Online fees collection for the research scholars, Online submission of soft copy of Synopsis and Thesis to speed up the processing. The status of Ph.D. synopsis and thesis submitted by the research scholars can be accessed online from Anna University website. For quick processing of claim bills of the scholars NEFT transfer is adopted and foreign remuneration are settled through SWIFT transfer. The entire gamut of activities of the Centre such as online functionalities, office administration, etc. including the website management have been conceived, designed and developed by in-house team. Evidence of success can be witnessed from drastic reduction in the duration between submission of thesis and award of degree from 8 months to 3 months on an average and increase in number of scholars receiving Ph.D. Degree. The number of Ph.D. awardees of Anna University from the inception (1978-2017) is 7930 while in the last three convocations (2014-2017) is 3902 and in the convocation held in 2017 alone is 1507. In the 35th convocation 1010 Ph.D. scholars are awarded degrees. This is an “All time High” number of Ph.D. awardees (for a calendar year) in convocation for Anna University and the highest number of Ph.D. awardees ever achieved by any other Technical University in India.

For my Master's degree, I decided to go to southern states to experience the culture, travel and the SERIOUS STUDIES (which later proved a myth). I belong to the 2015–18 batch of MCA, CEG.

( Just try to imagine the effort added by all other state people especially belonging to the general cat just to get admission here). I feel I just wasted my 3 years, I just wish if I could have invested my 3 years in something better. Poor and irresponsible professors.Speak all the bullshit stuff but rarely teach something that should be taught.The class environment gets poor than a primary school yes the professor does humiliate a student in front of the class. And students being afraid of raising voice lets it happen. (Remember if you tried to throwback or give a crisp reply your marks will be reduced like hell because they are only going to set and examine the papers. You may get arrear too)Even when there is nothing to learn in the classroom, attendance is a must.Lab sessions are just a waste of time and sometimes lab session which is for practical turns in theory class. Because they don’t teach anything in theory class. lol!If you are the other state candidate get ready to face race, a lot of humiliation and at last loss of your self-respect.You will be forced to accept and admire their culture and cuisine, even if you don’t like it.There are a lot more things to be added about this IST (Information Science and Technology Department of CEG) but I’ll stop here because a clever person will get my message with the above-written things itself. My condition was just like after digging a lot what all I found is simply garbage. Lastly, I would like to add an experience I recalled while writing this answer. Once just before 2 days of end sem exams, one of our professors returned our second internal papers which he was supposed to give at least 3 weeks before the start of the end sem. I found a big blunder in examining my paper. Let me tell you that was my favorite course and I had sleepless nights before that exam to give my best in that. After all the calculations I found there has to be 24 marks increment throughout all the answers. I called my professor and requested to meet. I pointed out all the answers where the increment has to happen and asked him how my answers are wrong. In a few minutes, he accepted that he has done mistakes and improved my marks +24. And that paper was a total of 50 and previously he gave me 22 or 23marks. While leaving he said, “sorry I was in pressure for end sem and didn’t check the papers thoroughly”, and he left. I was standing there shocked how could a professor in such a prestigious college could be so irresponsible. I was feeling sorry for my other class friends who studied dedicatedly, and the professor because of his own poor time management, made this blunder for them as well. Many more stories of the IST professors blunders but I don’t want to make this answer more lengthy. Note: All the above-written points are not related to other departments of CEG it's only for the IST (MCA branch 2015–18 batch). I am aware once CEG had a good name because of all the good and dedicated professors but gradually the reputation of it is falling down due to all the scams happening inside.

Matriculation and state board students have advantage over the CBSE students as the marks of CBSE students are normalized with respect to other boards. So CBSE which has tough syllabus than matriculation and State board will be pushed back.

If a student of the other Board (consider CBSE student) secures 70 marks in Physics when the first mark in Physics in the same Board is 95, 70 marks obtained by CBSE student will be considered to be equal to 73.68 (100 x 70 / 95 = 73.68%)For CBSE students, the marks obtained by the students in the relevant subjects in the qualifying examination conducted by various Boards or Authority shall be equated with the marks obtained by the students in the same subjects in the qualifying examination conducted by the State Board of Tamil Nadu by adopting the method of normalization.This is the only difference between the CBSE and state board.Good luck :) ",0.28431666666666666,Positive,3.5686333333333335,0.03225806451612903,1,4.5686333333333335

How hard they're trying, you'll never know. Then you get briefed on how to prepare for Group Discussions, how to dress for interviews etc. The university follows a simple policy when inviting companies. The companies which offer the largest CTC (Cost To Company ) or Salary get offered the schedule first. This means that the schedule for the first few months are completely filled with software firms like Myntra, Flipkart, Amazon which offer CTC north of 25 LPA. These firms allow students from circuit branches to attend the placement process. So, if you're someone who's from a non circuit branch like Mechanical, Production or Civil, you're sitting duck while your friends in CS are getting placed. However, there are a few companies like Citicorp which allow any branch students to sit for placements. But there's a catch. You need to have a CGPA of 9 or above with no history of arrears to sit in it. This criteria may/ may not be from the company itself. So if you're someone who thought grades don't matter for the first three years, this is the time where it starts to sting a little. Core companies for mechanical departments start trickling in for placements in the following months.

The average package is around 4 LPA in these companies. Caterpillar, Hyindai, BPCl and BEL offer CTC north of 8LPA. They take 2–6 students in total. There are also companies like Zoho, ZoomRx, TCS, Infosys, Cognizant, Wipro which allow all departments to attend the placements. Ultimately it all comes down to your luck on the particular day that decides whether you get a job or not. If you're a student who's up for counselling and have a chance to choose CS, IT in CEG or MIT, placements shouldn't be a worry factor. If you're thinking of taking Mechanical just because it's a popular department and people say that it's evergreen and there's a sure chance you'll get placed, then you're grossly mistaken. The college offers plenty of opportunity to learn and grow professionally. You can also take a look at the placement statistics available online. But they don't give you picture of the number of students placed in their field of study. As an example, a total of 20 were placed in Manufacturing department. So the statistic will say that 20 were placed out of 45 which is a decent percentage. But the reality is that only 5 of them got a job in a core company and the rest 15 got placed in IT sector. Same goes for other departments like Civil, Industrial and Production. So, you can't take the placement statistics available online in their face value. I hope I gave a comprehensive idea about the placements in CEG. Comment if you need me to address something in particular. Thanks! ",0.19879000000000005,Positive,3.39758,0.03225806451612903,1,4.39758

Some how you like the classic design of the building. You imagine suffixing your name with Istru engineer. You don’t know that this is Asia’s oldest Instrumentation program (Along with Aero and Production). Then you see a three storied, Department of Rubber & Plastics. That will be the first time you know that such a department exists. You look around yourself and realize every thing is made of these materials nowadays. You keep that as a wild card and stead further. You also see a building with a cool horse design and announces itself as Dept of Automobiles - The Royal Auto.and a group of most visibly proud bunch of students. You see giant lecture hall complexes which houses bulk of first year classes and you see a sea of students coming out of it. That is when you look at the biggest department of MIT- the Electronics and Communications Dept. You wonder why so many people study this course. You don’t realize that building houses one of the most complex and accomplished senior-junior relations in the country. Then you see them and it makes you stop and take a selfie. Those two airforce fighter jets albeit their engines rotting in a MIT dungeon, really makes you think about Aero dept standing behind those jets with their sexy red bricks. You probably know that apart from Dr.APJ Kalam, current ISRO chairman also studied in that building. Then you go past library, and Hangar to look at the old building which houses Production engineering and supposedly a newly introduced Mechanical engineering. The intro scenes of Gautham Vasudev Menon films flashes in your mind. Then you go past a hideous looking work shop and a hangar where students play indoor games. There you go. you see it. It is the dreaded MIT- hostel. Your dad asks the security - where is the rest of the college. He (with broken tamil) will say thats it. You will think - damn this college is small (not realising the true spirit of MIT). But you have not seen the hidden gems : the most important of infinity stones of MITverse. Ofcourse they are hidden and you have to take twisted turns and walk past dreaded grass to find them (:p). Many people almost select them out of luck with a reluctance only to rejoice how their stars aligned. Those are the twin sisters of MIT : Department of Computer Science & Department of Information technology. These departments provides you with excellent and most recent faculty. These departments have the highest package : highest average package : hell the highest number of stream placements. They are the Suresh Raina of MIT making bulk of the placement numbers in the institute. They also have a strong coding culture (I felt), strong management skills training (If you are upto it). They are also have the best GENDER RATIO in the institute. With MIT’s strong senior junior system (T-Series) and a Co-series system : say good bye to your boys/girls school curse. //These only apply to people without specific engineering interest. I chose Rubber & Plastics by interest and it was the best decision I made in my life// ",0.12273125,Positive,3.2454625,0.03225806451612903,1,4.2454625

If you are going to appear for the M3 Exam during your 6th Semester ( i.e 4th attempt ), the internal mark for the 3rd Semeste Continue ReadingLet us discuss about this in detail. Scenario 1. For example, Let us take a paper M3 (TPDE) which is your 3rd Semester paper. If you have internal marks 14 and scored 45 out of 100 (converted into 36 out of 80 ) in univ written exam, then(total 36+14=50) it is considered as Pass (E-Grade Minimum ). This scenario applies to the 3rd sem paper ( eg: m3 ) till your 5th Semester. (up-to three attempts i.e 3rd sem-1st attempt,4th sem-2nd attempt,5th sem-3rd attempt ) Scenario 2. If you are going to appear for the M3 Exam during your 6th Semester ( i.e 4th attempt ), the internal mark for the 3rd Semester arrear paper will not be carried to this 6th semester. Its validity is up-to the 5th Semester ( 3rd attempt ). When you don’t have the internal marks criteria, you must score 50 out of 100 in univ written exam, which is considered as Direct Pass ( E grade - Minimum). No conversion of marks from 100 to 80. Scenario 3. Similarly your 7th semester internal marks has the chance to carry up-to the next attempt after the final semester (for understanding consider it as 9th semester ). If you could clear all your papers within this (9th) Semester with Overall 60% (>=) your degree will be awarded with First Class, if lesser than 60% second class. All the internal marks criteria will be dropped during the second attempt after your final semester (for understanding consider it as 10th semester). If you could clear all your papers from the 10th sem to the last chance (6 attempts after final sem, for understanding consider it as 14th semester) your degree will be awarded with second class or lesser, no matter what the percentage you have. So students who have internal marks lesser than 10 ( within the 3 attempts) may find difficulties to clear the papers. Since the written exam mark needs to be matched (100 to 80 Conversion) with the appropriate internal. The attached table shows the mark you need to score for the respective grade and as per your existing internal marks.  If you have good internals (>=13) you can try to clear attempting on or before the third attempt (Scenario 1). If you have a very bad internals , you need to wait till the internal drops (Scenario 2,3) no matter how much effort you put, the internal and external marks does not match sometimes to clear or score a good grade. Some tire 3 engineering colleges and novice professors do this needfully to spoil the student carrier. But clearing the backlogs without internals is a little challenging and it is always a good score since the overall pass mark is scored without the support of internal marks. Even I had many backlogs due to very low internal marks(mostly 4or 5), but i did manage to clear those papers only during the fourth attempt i.e when the internal criteria dropped down (18 out of 21 cleared with less effort , other 3 are little bit difficult and need hardwork to clear). Prepare for exams atleast before one or two months, do not read this blog before exam night.Have a regular practice of writing before examination because the anwser in your brain will not reflect in the answer sheet, sometimes you may start scribbling during the last hour since you lost in touch with your handwriting.Hope this summary is useful.

I dont know with what dash she is asking questions from topics she did not teach in class. She is lab instructor for one of my friend's friend. It seems that for her ,only values are important and never cares if that students knows to do the experiment or not. If you write all the theory down correctly and if your values vary slightly form the original one and thats it, you would be marked zero and you should repeat that lab next sem and this happend to my friend.

Being a government institution she is also a government employee so she enjoys all luxuries a government employee enjoys but never does her duty properly.

The number of illustrious alumni the institution has produced is countless both pre and post independence era. CEG is the only institute to produce two test match cricket captains for India.

Muthiah, Actor Nagarjuna, Lyricist Madan Karky, Mu Sigma founder Dhiraj Rajaram, TVS Chairman Venu Srinivasan and the list goes on and on. Even today the institution holds a top 10 ranking in India as per the latest NIRF ranking for engineering colleges released by the Government of India in 2018. The only problem is the confusion with Anna University MHRD, National Institute Ranking Framework (NIRF) . People need to understand that CEG is a college and Anna University is an affiliating university. And if you will indulge me I will share the full story behind this confusion. The college was affiliated to University of Madras initially and in 1978 it got affiliated to Anna University (along with 3 other premier engineering institutions in Chennai). This did not cause much of a problem and the institution continued to attract the best of talent and faculty and if you go by the kind of P.G. admissions or placements that used to happen then it was creme de la creme. The real confusion started around 2004. There were many politicians wanting to make hay out of the engineering education boom. Engineering colleges were started in makeshift buildings, marriage halls and even cow sheds were getting converted in to engineering colleges. They had only one big issue and that was the reputation of their new colleges. With one magic wand called affiliation these politicians got all colleges in the state affiliated to Anna University. Suddenly they could hide their cowshed colleges and lack of infrastructure under such a strong brand. And the unfortunate downside is the way the 200,000 students affiliated to the University overcrowded the cream 1000 students of the state passing out of CEG. Over the last 10 years many alumni have cried foul and the absence of strong enough push from alumni association and faculty to drive the agenda the brand has remained submerged to some extent. But good talent and potential does not remain hidden for too long. In the last 2 - 3 years, realization has dawned among broader sections of the society including corporates, higher educational institutes and investors and CEG is slowly claiming back its identity. Unscrupulous politicians may come and go but institutions like CEG with a 225 year history cannot be vanquished so easily.
