The whole point behind including negative marking for wrong answers is to stop guess work. But that doesn’t mean that you totally stop guessing answers to MCQs . Guess work is useful when you can eliminate at least one of the four options in the MCQ.(This is the place where students get filtered). So stop thinking about the negative marking and work on strategies that how you can benefit out of it.

This gives the students who get such internships to secure a PPO (pre-placement offer) but very few companies come for summer placements Companies also visit the campus in the 7th sem with three types of opportunities:- 1) Only Internship - where students intern at the firm during the last semester (starting in Jan, ending in May/June). Here a full-time offer will be given based on the student’s internship performance and requirement of the firm. 2) Only Full-Time Employment (FTE) - This is the usual full-time job offer which will start after graduation. 3) Both Internship and FTE- Internship + Assured job offer.

Recently, a survey was conducted where many students filled out answers to the questions as to where they stay and is it viable for them to come from their native states to Bangalore to write exams.

I think the college should conduct exams for the 6th semester students and for final year students. The rest can be promoted. As it is important for the immediate placement season. But how they conduct the exams will be a problem. How they do it and when they do it. I am in Bangalore itself and living near PES university. There has been no cases here and since the lockdown was lifted 80% of the people dont wear masks and dont follow social distancing. So i think it will be very dangerous for people here and the students coming from interstate travel to contact the virus. Many students who have answered this question have written that online classes havent been effective. I dont believe that. Atleast for my semester, the online classes were conducted admirably and the doubts were cleared really well. The teachers kept asking for feedback and kept explaining a topic if the student asked for it again. It was better than offline classes for some subjects. And for revision also many teachers discussed and explained previous year question papers. Overall a good experience. Even if students couldnt watch it online at that time due to data issues, 2 months are more than enough to catch up on that. The recorded videos are still in impartus. Bottom line is, I want to write the exams but how and when it happens will be a concern. Just hope that no corona cases come up. ",-0.028009999999999993,Neutral,2.94398,0.56,1,1.9439799999999998

Due to bandwidth issues all across India, Internet speeds weren't good for many students, leading to disturbances in the video/audio quality. The same Internet issues could crop up while giving the exams, if conducted online. Deputy CM of Karnataka Dr. Ashwat Narayan recently spoke about offline classes being held before the exams to help the students. This would be more ideal than keeping the exams directly although this comes with its own set of issues with regards to the academic calendar.

That 100 rated Mbappe is too overrated with his lightning fast speed and great finishing ability. However, YOU CAN STOP HIM !!, I'm not at all joking on this. Although he had a good amount of pace and finishing, we have to plan to stop him, before he gets past of the defensive line, using the offside trap in his advantage. Tips to stop the 100 rated Mbappe: Choosing the right defender - The defender with very good aggression, heading and defensive prowess will help a lot. Ex.: Van Dijk, Koulibaly, Ramos, De Ligt, etc.Stop focusing on the formation - It is your formation, you practiced it for a good amount of time, you know how to play and pass the ball, keep possession and counter-pressing. Have faith in your team, you will do really well. I have defeated many good teams with a 3–4–3 formation too!Understand the defensive tactics - Do not rush your defender behind the striker or the attacker. Always make an angle while intercepting the ball. Do not rush a single defender to tackle the striker, the wingers are always left in open spaces because of this mistake. Make sure to let the striker be close enough to tackle or intercept at your advantagous space (space where your players’count is more than the opponent's). Keep practicing this skill and you will find the difference.Understand the role of DMFs - DMFs do a really good job by providing an extra layer of defense. Good DMFs like Casemiro, Busquets, Pjanic, Vieira, etc. will always help you with any line of attack, especially, Vieira.Tactical foul, the dirty tactic - You now know, Mbappe has got past your defenders, now it's time for some dirty tricks - tactical fouls. Yes, it's always better to have a yellow card than a goal.I guess this might help you a lot with the Mbappe issue. I have a YouTube channel named PES MASTER. Link is in the bio of my profile.

Finding the output of the code and alike. This comes only by practice. Practice a lot of problems and never stop learning more topics in it. The basics should be very clear and since there is a limitation in time, you should be very fast in solving. This too comes with practice. The other thing you should practice is General Aptitude. This is a vast subject to learn. Problems like work and time, trains, pipes and cisterns, counting figures, counting lines in a figure, age problems, hcf and lcm, coding and decoding etc are asked. To be an expert in this, you have to start early and keep preparing year round. It is asked everywhere, so it wouldnt be a waste, to invest your time in it.

141,141,PES-University-1,Is the product design course at PES University comparable to other top private design colleges such as Srishti or MITID?

This is a fundamental misunderstanding of what design is. A designer is someone who understands his target market and designs appropriately. He doesn't “make a new product “ or “ make something pretty “. His job is to understand and make something professional and appealing to a target audience such that it resonates with them. Design from an engineering aspect is like journalism with a geology aspect: complete rubbish.

This is a fundamental misunderstanding of what design is. A designer is someone who understands his target market and designs appropriately. He doesn't “make a new product “ or “ make something pretty “. His job is to understand and make something professional and appealing to a target audience such that it resonates with them. Design from an engineering aspect is like journalism with a geology aspect: complete rubbish. You would very frankly be better off learning about psychology and sociology than engineering if you want to be an industrial designer. Good engineers are usually terrible designers. Indian designers are not like western ones, and no college in India has been proven capable of teaching students of how to bring a concept to manufacture ready in a 6 month timeframe. The things you learn in 4 years at NID, IIT, MIT-ID and Srishti will be covered in the first year of Emily Carr, Loughborough and Umea. Even a state school in USA teaches industrial/product design at a much, much more advanced level. So let's end that discussion there. Secondly, I do not recommend any new colleges for design. At all. period. The list is this: Nid ,iitb, iitg, MIT-id, Symbiosis, Srishti, DJAD. That's it. Don't believe me? Go on LinkedIn or Google Jobs and see job postings. Very frequently, you will get an outright preference for NID and IIT-B only. Sometimes you will also get a Srishti or MIT-id here and there. Symbiosis and DJAD too. Even Pearl and Isdi never come in the list despite being in the industry for far longer than PES. Thirdly ,let's talk about “product design “ ,namely scope. A lot of kids have probably heard that “product design has a lot of scope"" and this is true , but not for the reason you think it is. See, UI design has a huge variety of synonyms, like UX ,interface, motion graphics, interaction, etc. One of these synonyms is “ product design” , but this actually refers to digital products. These guys are mostly front end coders, not design professionals who specialize in layout. Thus, this term has a lot more to do with Ux , animation and graphic design than physical product design. In reality, classical industrial design has very little scope in india , since india doesn't actually have a true open market. The Government doesn't export a lot of products to other countries, so india has little incentive to demand design. Also, big companies do not need indian talent because almost all indian colleges, INCLUDING NID, are utter trash at design education when you compare them to their foreign counterparts. So the actual product design gigs are of low quality and uninteresting ,and these shit gigs will have MANY applications, mostly over 200. Meanwhile , great openings by companies like Cadbury and Kellogg's in the UK have like only 10 to 30 applicants. If you think there are a lot of jobs, trust me there aren't. Most ID professionals shift to UX since India is only a 3rd rate IT server economy that doesn't value anything for that matter. And great industrial design studios keep it very low, and they never take anyone so don't think there are many studio openings. I do not recommend a design job in India unless you have good to great aptitude. By that I mean you are EXTREMELY creative. Do something more worthwhile. Fourthly, there's something happening in every design college in India, something called a “ faculty crisis"" . What do I mean by that? Since there are very very stablished design professionals in the industry (around 100 to 150 with more than 10 years experience, since india only opened its market in 1991 under Singh's directive), there are not enough experienced designers who are capable of teaching students. Most of these professionals teach at NID after working for 18+ years, and some in private colleges like MIT-ID and Srishti. So what about newer colleges? They offer better packages to fresh masters graduates or PhD students than corporate postings, so these students decide to teach with minimal design experience. Plus faculty get shifted around good colleges too, due to expansion of the design education industry. In other words, the design education industry is more profit generating than the actual industry. Therefore, there are a lot of recycled graduates-turned-professors, and this will become worse as experienced professionals retire from teaching. So the actual good faculty is limited to these top colleges. Now you make your call. ",0.13962982456140352,Positive,3.279259649122807,0.0,0,3.279259649122807

Compensating for national holidays on Saturdays is the only way to make sure no courses are lagging behind and everything is completed on time. There are a few a things about this structure which I liked during my study at PES University: Enough time off between the semesters to complete internships. Other colleges under VTU/some other private colleges are not able to provide such flexibility because of the way the semesters are structured.They are preparing you for the corporate world. Most of the corporates currently have a 5 day flexible work week where you work Monday through Friday so that you get the weekends off. A similar approach is followed at PES. Additionally, in corporates if you work on a national holiday/weekend you are eligible to take a compensatory off during one of your working days. At PES they are following the exact reverse of this. They ask you to attend classes on a Saturday if there is a national holiday in the middle of the week, to make sure you don't lag behind the plan.I hope this helps.

Campus placement of an engineering degree holder from any Indian engineering college happens when some engineering company tries to fill some engineering position in the company and carries out campus placement at various engineering colleges and pays the employees the salary and respect of an engineer. Since such fraud engineering colleges do not produce any skilled engineer, hence NO engineering company carries out campus placement to recruit skilled engineers from such colleges.  Such colleges can also open tent-house business using the money paid as fee by its students and shift its degree holders as waiters in its tent house business. And such waiters do not get the salary and respect of an engineer. This is what is happening throughout India.  Since there is nothing called as ECE in 2019, hence there is NO answer to this question. Praveen Kumar Singh's answer to What is the scope and the salary of an ECE?

Strictly speaking minor has a very little or no importance for placements. Companies don’t care if you have done minor or not, all they care is that how well you know the core concepts. Minor surely adds an advantage to your CV but that also is subjective to what company you are sitting for. If you are a CSE student and want to sit for CSE companies your minor won’t increase your chances of placements. The best reason for you to do a minor is sheer interest. If you are a non-CSE student and want a CSE company , doing a minor will have a profound affect to your CV. Firstly you will know the core concepts properly. Secondly you will be having interesting projects to talk about during interviews. Placements = coding skills + core concepts + good projects + soft skills. Now coming to further studies. As minor is a new concept in PESU the importance of minor in further studies in not well known. However minor is a well known concept in US and all. So, what I think is that minors will surely add a value to your CV if it is related to your field of study. I would like to emphasis here that minor courses in PESU is not as good as the normal classes courses. Doing a minor during the semester is not an easy task. I have seen a lot of people enrolling in minor courses yielding to peer pressure. First have a little thought on why you need to do minors and then only proceed. The best time to do minors according to me is during the summer breaks. There are total 4 core courses in any minor. Do the 1st two during the first summer break and the last two during your second year summer break. Also the minor courses in PESU are made somewhat easier than normal class courses as people from all branches will be enrolled. Do your minors seriously and try to get your hands dirty with some good projects. ",0.17229130434782608,Positive,3.344582608695652,0.24,1,4.344582608695652

In results I was shocked for my rank 28k then understood that I wouldn't get cse there according to my rank and If I would like to do also It is expensive. Then I attended pessat 2019 healthily and got a rank of 655 enquired about college near to me transport is fast to me from my native place and hostel was good then joined in PES . I'm going to college this August 2nd for my orientation of cse program. Thank you. This is my longest answer written hoping for good number of upvotes.

I'm from Bangalore and it would make more sense for me to choose PES compared to VIT. Placements and teaching are not issues in PES. Since, I'm in a circuit branch, Bangalore is the best place for me in terms of tech opportunities.(internships, research, jobs, electronics, etc) Therefore I would suggest PES over VIT. Location is also a major factor for opportunities. The class strength of VIT is on the higher side. I guess that could impact the quality of education too. Hope this helps.

In fact many good companies like Myntra/grofers/unacademy hired only south campus students as they came late and PESU students who were good enough to be hired in these companies were already into their internship.

In PESU you can do minors in CSE and sit for 80% of the high salary CSE companies which come for placements. PESU placements are definitely better than MS Ramaiah. But a few things you have to consider: 2019 admitted batch in PESU will have 18 CSE sections ( 10 main campus and 8 south campus ) plus 9 ECE sections ( 6 main campus and 3 south campus ) so competition for high paying jobs will be huge although tier 2 jobs will be easily available ( CTC 4–8 Lakhs as of 2019 ) ECE is the worst department in South Campus although teachers are highly qualified their ego is sky high. In VTU they used to make life hell for students. As department classes under PESU will start from August 2019 we still don’t know if their will be any difference ( feedback from teachers is that there will be a change and PESU will be much more student friendly than VTU ) Also placement activity happens in main campus so 7th Semester is going to be very hectic going to college and then running to main campus if you are shortlisted although as 2019 admitted batch is not VTU and their own University they will be more considerate in attendance , internal exams etc than they are for VTU students .

The girl’s hostel is outside the college, at three different locations. The same goes for boys, three different hostels, but luckily they are inside the campus with a limited number of rooms.Branch- Telecom curriculum is 50% in the match with the EEE, their core subjects are part of the EEE course, but the credits are less. Overall you can get the taste of both the branches in EEE.Future opportunities- Besides, EEE has the advantage of being a core branch, future opportunities are much better. Even if you want to go for GATE exam or higher studies, EEE would be a better choice.

If you didn’t get decent branches in any of the major IIT’s or NIT’s, and want to study CS, then go for it blindly. The faculty is good, the syllabus is excellent, and placements are really good if you get good grades and perform well. A few people from here have been chosen for companies like Microsoft (obviously, they worked hard enough to deserve that, and these are one-off cases). I can’t speak for people in other branches, but this place is pretty good for CS.Internships inside the college are nice. The college has a few centres for research that are doing decent work (Cloud Computing, Applied Machine Learning etc.). You’ll learn a lot from the internships and you can out projects that you do in them in your CV, which is cool.Of course, there are a few drawbacks. If you want to stay in the hostel, life may be a little irritating because the hostel has a lot of rules (most of which nobody follows, but still). For example, you can’t wear shorts or three-fourths inside the college at all. You have to carry your college ID card as well as your hostel ID card at all times, which is a pain.And as of today, the college is under renovation and there’s a lot of construction work going on, so all the sports facilities have been destroyed. If you want to play sports here, forget it until the construction is finished. There is a gym though if you want to keep fit. There are clubs for music, art, writing, dramatics and stuff, but don’t expect them to be great (and of course, time management is important so you can balance hobbies and studies). So as far as extracurriculars go the college has almost nothing. Fests are nothing special either but sometimes they bring famous singers for concerts like Amit Trivedi and Shankar-Ehsaan Loy.And if you like the party life (smoking, drugs, sex etc.) this is not the place for that. They’re very strict about not allowing any of that stuff inside the campus, which I personally like. If you stay in a PG, you can still indulge in these vices, so make of that what you will.If you enter via PESSAT, fees are really goddamn high. My batch had 3 lpa, but it’s gone up quite a bit now.

First of all our PES has a lot of tie ups with really good foreign Universities like CMU etc. In your third year summer you get to do research under one of the best minds. The university itself has more than 5 research centersCCBD( Cloud Computing and Big Data)CDSAML ( Applied machine Learning )ALCoding ( Programming intensive )Microsoft innovative labs (IOT stuff)CORI ( space related) and many more visit Research and check it out yourself, Above listed Centers are well funded and are well maintained with good mentors and good paper throughput. Second the location of the university is in Bangalore which is majorly know for i) weather (really good )ii) Its wide array of software companies, Which is a major advantage for a Computer science grad cause PES is considered the BEST university for its CSE B-Tech course, So many major players in the software industry like Microsoft(39 LPA), Walmart, PayPal, Couch Base, CITRIX and many more come to the university with high pay grade, good Job profile(which is more important in the long run). The Facility is really good.The best part of it all is the peer pool is one of the best in the country well mannered, nice and smart people. we have good access to public transport especially the METRO which is less than a km away which helps us to keep in touch with the beautiful city life of Bangalore. As a current undergrad student myself, I am proud to be a part of PESU culture.

As usual, the total/maximum marks a student can obtain is 100. 100 marks are divided into 3 parts. Part 1: Internals/CBTs- There are two CBTs(Computer Based Tests) in a semester, each for 40 marks each. Each test is reduced to 15 marks for the final tally/grade. Therefore internals, constitute 15+15=30 marks for the final grade. Part 2: The majority of the marks are taken from the End Semester Examinations (ESAs). The final exam is for 100 marks, but reduced to 60 marks. Hence the total marks including part 1 & part 2 for final grading is 30+60=90 Part 3: The last 10 marks are for assignments/project Teachers usually give 2 assignments over the course of the semester, each one being 5 marks each. But in sometimes this may defer and depends on the teacher. So this is how the marks are given to every student. The grading system is usually relative, i.e the benchmark for 100% is decided keeping in mind the highest marks scored by a student (the topper basically).

Very few solid roles for students. Again CGPA is a huge criteria. No one cares about the role. It's just about getting placed. Company might have 7 as cut off but since they have 1000s of people, cut off can be as cruel as 8.88 and others are not allowed to participate in that company's placement.

They literally had 6000 people for graduation on the same day! They didn't have the sense to keep it on different days for different branches. Obvious cost cutting! How could they differentiate students? GPA. Yes, it's alarming but so 6000 people got their degree GPA wise. Utterly disappointing. Brute force treatment to students and some of them with below 8.5 were made to sit in different buildings and be discriminated. In our 7th semester, they failed 1/3rd of the students in some branch and reannounced the results and made some people pass. Re grading was very common, which questions transparency. They justify it by saying relative/absolute grading was not performed. I've applied for revaluation all semesters, and every time my grade has improved. This shows the poor quality in this system. I sincerely think Jawahar is robbing money from people. The teaching is also very sub-par. There are professors with 0 work experience and there are some who again said that “GPA” is everything. Jawahar is given a golden spoon and he gives “great” speeches (some like study 30 hours in a week for 9CGPA). Many of the professors children also study here for obvious reasons.
