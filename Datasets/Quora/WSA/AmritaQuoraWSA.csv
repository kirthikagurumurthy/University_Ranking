If you meant something else, do let me know. However, it is possible the following answer could still be relevant. <edit> Okay I missed the topics on the question, one of which is the Amritapuri campus and of course GEC Thrissur and College of Engineering, Trivandrum as well. My bad!</edit> I can give you an anecdote of someone I know who was in a similar position few years ago but in a different branch(CSE). He had a very good rank in the Kerala entrance exam(somewhere in 500s IIRC) However, he chose not to join CET, GEC or any other good college you can name in Kerala and chose to study in Amritapuri campus. Few people somehow got to know this and naturally, many were bewildered by the choice. “Why would someone who is this good come to study in a private institution(that too this specific campus!) which is considered by many as lower ranked than many other colleges in Kerala but also very much more expensive?” was probably their thought process. I think he was initially slightly affected by in the first semester or so but after that, didn’t make a big deal of it. He remembered some reasons why he chose this campus(personal reasons I’m not privy to) and then decided to make best of his time there. He did pretty well in the FOSS club on campus and developed pretty amazing skills during his time. He went on to pursue Masters with funding, get a nice job and is now doing a PhD in a really good lab. He still continues to be involved as a mentor in the club and helps people out. He does not ever regret joining Amrita and Amritapuri campus: he feels it’s the best thing that’s happened to him and he feels he probably wouldn’t have got similar opportunities and exposure elsewhere. If he could go back, he would never change the decision to join Amrita and the Amritapuri campus. There are so many clubs and opportunities in Amrita which are just not available in GEC-T, CET or anywhere else. I don’t deny that they are good institutions but I just haven’t seen a similar level of achievements from students in these institutions as I have from Amrita. For instance, the students from HuT labs have been very active and participating in several international competitions but I haven’t heard of many other such teams from Kerala. Similarly the AmFOSS club and team bi0s at Amritapuri campus are extremely good and active in several programs such as the Google Summer of Code and cybersecurity CTF competitions. bi0s is the number 1 team in India and AmFOSS club has been in top 10 in number of students selected for GSoC worldwide multiple years! Personally, I’ve not heard a similarly active club in other colleges. There are multiple research labs doing awesome work like Amrita WNA, AMMACHI and HuT labs to name a very select few and students can also be a part of the lab working on some interesting ideas. So you are not in an institute without much opportunities to do good things. You should start leveraging them and make the most of them. But of course, if you do regret, you can always switch to one of the other institutions next year. It would be a waste of a year but a year is just a very small time that wouldn’t have much impact. I would say explore things you can do on campus to see if there’s something that interests you and helps you build your skills for this year. You might find something interesting and worthwhile to do. Finally I believe that your future is, to a good extent, in your hands. Regretting and not regretting in future is thus also in your hands: you have the power to decide which happens. Good luck! <edit>If someone else gives you their opinion that you should have gone to GEC/CET/elsewhere, ask them why. Analyse their answer and then decide if it’s worth it. Statements like “Oh education is much cheaper there”, “Placements are better there” need better analysis etc. For the former, you should compare RoI and not just that the fees is less. For the latter, gather best stats you can obtain and compare to decide. Do not take any handwaving statements at face value: gather data, analyse them and decide their veracity.</edit> ",0.30835789473684216,Positive,3.6167157894736843,0.1,0,3.6167157894736843

(just to name some - GSoC, Outreachy, RGSoC, SoK, international/national tech conferences/hackathons/open source meetups, and many more)  Summing up, SkillsA B.Tech degree will not equip you with the technical skills nor the inter personal skills (which everyone needs and is much less emphasized on) like effective communication, team work or organizing events, convincing people, writing skills, and the list goes on and on. So you’re gonna sit in the classroom and get a 9 or 10 pointer and do nothing else? Good luck. CommunityApart from the skills that you can get from the club, I believe the community is a more important and more under looked aspect of all of it. Your atmosphere, your friends - the people with whom you decide to share your time with - will define who you become in life. In amFOSS, you are sitting among Friends - People like you . Like minded people who share your will to learn and do something.Seniors and Alumni - From my personal experience, they can be the best people you can possibly have. People who have the mentality to help and guide, not only in technically but also in trivial ordinary stuff, much like how elder brothers/sisters are. All you need to be is dedicated and be open.Skills can be learned but the ecosystem that the community provides is what stands out and is what really matters in the end. No reason not to be part of this awesome community :) ",0.4062368421052631,Positive,3.8124736842105262,0.1,0,3.8124736842105262

It is a revolution. The students of Amrita amritapuri campus have been suffering from unhygienic food and cleanlilessness for the past decade. These problem exist in all Amrita campuses from the day the university was born. The incident happened on 20 march 2018 was one of the 4 times happened in the past 4 months. The intensity of such practices have been increasing rapidly and are happening more oftenly than before. And also during the strike students also suffered from lathi charge from police without doing any violence at the midnight. The strike was very peaceful. Still police attacked the students inside the campus. This does not look like justice to me.

In which I got a pretty good internels (he told me that he will fail me on my face, for coming late to one fucking class). I am studying 6th year still now he is failing me in the subject. Faculty can play in your life. Attrition between the faculties, can cost you. They will reduce the grade or fail you. Full of internal politics. There is option called reevaluation. I don't even know, someone passed using that. But instead failed. Re appearance is another option which is also useful without internals. You will be pushed to last option called Re-registration The most fucked up rule is that Re-registration, you want to go to class with the juniors. Sit with them study with them for a whole semester. How frustrating is this. But faculties think it is cool. Because of this rule lot of people suicide in Amrita. I too had a lot of suicidal thoughts. But not worth it. Not for the shit like Amrita. In every college students keep arrears. I am not blaming the college for my arrears. But the difference comes in clearing those. It is very hard to clear a arrear (Prior to 2015 batch). This is totally a fucked up college. If I ask a faculty to pass me. They will reply with, if I do that I won't be true to my profession. They will get 4–8 lakhs for a management. In the name of the trust (They have a strong support from Central Ruling party). Is there a truth in a profession now?? That too yearly fees nearly 3 lakhs This amount of fees, food is not good. Wardens thinks themself like a commissioners. Watchmen thinks everyone as a terrorist. One time my mom was not allowed inside the college. Worst feeling I ever got. Amrita is only money focused. Some people may think it is about religious or divine. Everything is about making money. My advise First Don't complain and waste your valuable time. No use of complain. They will take no action. They won't even help you out. Second Try to study and not to keep arrears Third Don't join this college. Join someother college and enjoy life. No use of petition. This college will never change.

So no issues.The gate pass.This, is probably the only problem that I see most objected. You have to apply a day prior to get a pass sanctioned to go home or outside the campus.Ofcourse, you could ask your parents to call up the warden and they’d issue an emergency pass.The food, I’ve heard too commonly to be revolting and boring.Personally, I just don’t like the afternoon menu. Morning and Night, I’m a fan of the food they give. Except that the chapatis sometimes are harder than usual, because they’re machine-made. Fair trade.Here, there’s another fact to consider. It’s a general thought process among the students to be complaining about mess food. So, looking through their coloured glasses, ofcourse they’ll convince themselves they were true.Ragging issues.The university is very strict about this, and one of my classmates has been suspended for an year for a ragging case, of hurting a first year physically.I’ve got a suggestion to make here.Personally I see ragging as a way people who have insecurities about they’re dignity convince themselves that they’re important by demanding respect from their juniors. What can you do if you’re in such a situation?I’d suggest respect them, because they’ll be glad you helped their ego, and chances are, might let you go. If it doesn’t look like it is, or they’re starting to disturb you physically or ask for money, get help. Call the national anti-ragging helpline, 1800–180–5522. Once filed as a complaint there, they contact the Uni and ensure that strict action has been taken.Amrita, I don’t think it should bother you a lot because most of the seniors are aware of the consequences. However, there are some freshers that talk back to the seniors disrespectfully, and this might just provoke them to do something. Stay safe, give a little respect, or atleast pretend to be giving some.Academic syllabi for freshers. Personally, I felt this too. There aren’t a lot of core subjects coming in on the first year. All branches follow the same syllabi. Hence, most of it might seem dull for somebody who wanted further education in their core subjects.Hanging out with the opposite gender.There are a couple of professors who don’t want to see you hanging out with a lot of girls/boys. If you know that your intentions are pure, I’d suggest you best ignore them.The CGPA!Here’s the biggest guy of all. This little thing matters so much to the students and the parents. So much that it has been promoted from being the academic benchmark, to “life benchmark”.I do ask for the CGPA of my friends, and I see that some are reluctant to share the same. This kinda explains that they’re afraid of people judging them. I would say my CGPA without reluctance, because I know for a fact that it has nothing to do with how good/bad I am as a human.There.

Thus, I cannot provide information about Manipal. I assume you're asking about B.Tech in CSE at Amritapuri. I've written about why studying CSE at Amritapuri is a good idea before. See Ar Vind's answer to Is cs. branch of amritapuri campus(amrita university) is good to join? Placements are pretty good; I don't have access to any statistics though since it's rarely released. From what I little I know, I believe most of the eligible students(> 6 GPA and probably more criteria apply) get at least one job from some company. The Amrita brand name probably doesn't match up to IITs, NITs and the likes but it is pretty well known in quite a few places(companies and universities) since some alumni has likely been there. Hostel life isn't the best at Amritapuri compared to other campuses but it's not unbearable. Freedom is much better than other campuses - there are not many restrictions for boys. Girls would have more restrictions in place but it's still less than other campuses I think. First years might have some additional restrictions in place to ensure nothing untoward happens. I don't know about opportunities at Manipal so I can't compare the two. The FOSS club, ICPC team and the CTF team are good opportunities for those who are interested in exploring FOSS, sport programming and security respectively. If you're interested in other sub-disciplines, just drop by FOSS club and figure out how to pursue that interest. There are several more opportunities available - internships in research labs(in-house and outside), exchange programmes and more(read the answer I'd linked earlier). I think this is a pretty good set of opportunities available for a CS student I hope you got a decent picture of what things are like in Amritapuri.

Mess food are all same in all hostels even all hostel mess follows same menu, whether it is boys hostel mess girls hostel http://mess.So don’t get confused for choosing hostel and mess. I was staying with two more roommates.The rooms will be of two types-Air conditioned and Air cooler.3 Seater hostels rooms has 3 iron bed,3 Plastic Chair,3 almirah,geyser with attached washroom. Our rooms were spacious, gave us privacy and also gave us space to hangout with friends and chit chat, do projects, spend movie nights and game on! Apart from this facilities they are providing other facilities also- Free internet connectivity through Wi-Fi system for scheduled timing for academic purposes only. In Campus Physiotherapy Clinic and Hospital with resident doctors and ambulances to provide medical assistance to students,Power backup for light load only (not for AC/Geyser/Air cooler),24 hours security.,Laundry Services (optional on payment basis),hygienic and nutritious vegetarian meals (optional),Hostel counsellors ( solve the problems of students in context of family issues, studies, home sickness etc),Laundry facility,Gym facility to remain fit. Honestly I won’t lie about the mess at campus, because I myself took food for the first 6 months at the hostel mess until I explored other good places but there are so many people who actually like mess.The quality of food that we get in the mess is very good. One of the things that LPU does the best is that is regularly checks the food quality and any complain about the food is dealt with immediately.Everyday Food menu gets changed.I had some friends from Kerala,Andra Pradesh,Telangana so they were provided south indian food and I am found of Idli,vada,dosa so sometimes we used to shared the foods also. One after the tiresome day can have a hot meal in a timely manner. Sometimes during some festive day like Diwali, Holi, they surprise you with some different meals and believe me food was really awesome. Study room, TV room, Saloon, Photocopy Machines, Departmental store for daily needs, Cafeteria, vending Machine (soft drinks), Lifts and Parking facility. You can't carry alcohol and smoking products inside the campus and hostels. Because security guards are the king and if you're found involved in such activities, you will get into trouble.

Being a girl is unfair in this place, there is strict timings for each and everything. The classes in college gets over at 4:00 and girls have to be at hostel before 5:30. It is considered for the safety of the girls but honestly the authorities won’t understand the fact that nearly all the girls won’t misuse the extra time given after college. No girl is allowed to walk alone to any place, Let it be to a restaurant nearby or to buy stationary from a shop. That basically means, Girls are treated here as a flock of sheep, girls have to move in groups and come in groups. If you are seen hanging out with the opposite gender by the wardens, they would ask many question for absolutely no reason. The hostel rules is so strict that it would feel like you are in a prison. There is no hospital facilities inside the hostel and girls have to cross the bridge to go to one. The mindset of some people here is pretty stereotypical in this place and everyone hates to face it. For boys, Freshers are made to stay in the ashram side hostel where the rooms are quite cramped and not adequate by any means. Boys have to cross the bridge every single day to reach the campus which is quite a distance. There is a beach nearby the hostel and there is restrictions to some degree. Boys are not allowed to wear shorts which is below there knees inside the ashram, if caught they would literally make the boy to change their shorts. Boys have lesser restrictions as compared to girls in this place, boys should be at the hostel before 8:30 maximum unless you are a part of a student club like FOSS or Bi0s. From Second year, Boys hostel is shifted near the campus, where there are common washrooms as compared to the ashram side hostel which has attached washroom. Coming to the common grounds, The mess foodis not that great and you can even find many staffs saying the same thing. If you have to enter the college You should need a ID card, unless you are not allowed until you did enough pleadings with the authority. The usage of mobile phones inside the campus is strictly restricted, if caught the phone won’t be returned at least for a week. Just like any other college If you have any contacts over here, you wouldn’t get into any trouble. You have to wear your full uniform no matter what. Most of the Teachers here are good and teach well except for a hand full, the guidance of the teachers can not be questioned that easily. There are good student clubs as well. Everything is fine or to least say bearable in some cases but the authorities is kind of really outdated with their rules and regulations which does nothing other than stressing up students even more.

Instead of handing over drug cases to police they suspend their students (no matter what amount of drug is kept in hand) and speak of ethics in public. U mad, bro? Amrita University, if you have a better option, is never the place I’d recommend. I just can’t wait to get out of this place. :) ",0.10089545454545455,Positive,3.201790909090909,0.25,1,4.201790909090909
