And now what I feel is that postgraduate student is mature enough. They know the importance of time. In NITK, students prefer to spend their spare time near beach. I don’t think involving in ragging activity is more cool than spending time near NITK beach. One of my friend has completed M.Tech from NIT Trichy in 2020. She never mentioned anything about ragging. She always told me that her senior helped her alot to excel in campus placement exam. In both the NIT there is one anti ragging community.

But in previous years, on campus placement used to be around 95%.Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) has set up a Regional Academic Centre for Space at National Institute of Technology Karnataka to carry out the advanced joint research and development activities in the area of space technology.Well known, NITK has its own private beach. It's just 10 minutes away by walk from your hostel and you can enjoy the beautiful evening by watching the mesmerising sunset. If you manage to get a girlfriend at NITK, you would visit beach every now and then otherwise you won't. And this beach is not at all suitable for taking bath. Many students have died by getting drowned every year. Just have fun at seashore but don't dare to go inside the water body.There are many core industries nearby NITK. If you fail to get a paid internship in any company, you can approach professors or any localite whose parents or relatives are working in any of these industries,they can easily get you an unpaid internship. You will get a certificate to mention in your resume. Mostly you will be benefited if you are from civil, electrical, metallurgy or chemical engineering department.There are many shops and canteens in our campus but the best part is you will get your items delivered at your hostel if you order your items through “ChangePay” app which is exclusively for NITK students. Though they are trying to expand their business in other colleges too.Every year on 26th of January on the occasion of Republic Day, DDFC one of the clubs of NITK, organises a one day fest called “BHARAT DARSHAN” where students of every states perform and describe their diverse and unique culture through drama, dance etc. There is always cut throat competition among the different states to win the title.We have virtual lab in our campus. For more info you can visit Virtual LabsWe have Centre for System design (CSD) at NITK. For more info you can visit Centre for System Design. If you are good at singing or dancing or acting, you can record your song or video. Some of my juniors have composed song and recorded their voice and videos.There are many tourist places which are very feasible to visit from our college. e.g- Kayaking, Coorg, Goa, Manipal, Malpe beach, kudremukh, Chikmagalur, mysore, Bangalore, ooty, jog falls etc. You will easily get two wheeler or four wheeler on rent. Your rented vehicle (s) would be just a call away at reasonable price. In fact if you are a travelling freak, you can plan your places to visit year wise. There are so many places to visit nearby if you are in NITK.Our college has Mining Department which is unique in itself as very less IITs and NITs possess it. We have MCA and MBA programs available too with good placement statistics.Less important points:- a. We have swimming pool in our campus. Boys and girls can’t swim together because there are different timings for boys and girls. So don't be over excited. b. You can see beautiful peacocks in our campus. Not often but spotting snakes at different places at NITK would become very normal thing to you. No need to be afraid. c. There is a highway between the college that is NH-66. So you need to be very careful while crossing the road if you are going to west campus of the college. d. We have relative grading not absolute grading system means your pointer would be decided by the marks obtained by the topper of the class. e. Never forget to carry your umbrella in rainy season (in odd semester). There is no timing for raining. It will happen for short period of time but you may get drenched because the rain would be very unexpected but no water logging at all. I think I have almost mentioned everything that I find unique about NITK. Thanks to my friends who helped me in writing bullets points about NITK. HOPE IT HELPS. THANK YOU!!

First thing to know about me is my Home state,Delhi and the second thing that you must know about me is I'm traveler. What I literally type is not only my opinion (or say feelings) but also opinion of many people out here in India who is suffering like a hell in India just because his/her being a migrant within India. It all started with a kid of nearly 11 years old . I was sent to kerala(2009) in my very 6th std since the literacy rate of kerala was good . I was staying in the junoir hostel with many other students of other regions of India. They were all good and have good human nature. But the thing that most hurted me is that even though we were all under 16 years of age we formed our own place group like delhi people together,Malayalam people together,Bihar and UP together,assam and Bengal together,karnataka a single group,and lot .I personally hate this even now. If you them why is it so? Probably you may get the same reply as I used to get “communication problems “,”same culture” etc .Do you feel is it a reason to live separately ? And come on you people speak good English too. And do you still call it as a UNITY? if yes then think twice. But whatever is the thing we Indians have always one thing as common denominator is that we all Indians are like this. And still some people might ne blaming me by calling me as a ‘DELHI GUY IS ALWAYS LIKE THIS ‘ . And what if I surprise you people by telling you that I'm from Mumbai not delhi. Think? We Indian judge Indians on the basis of his/her state. Okay you may still think I'm childish and not at all matured telling all these rubbish.And I guarantee,If you are matured enough you would have probably understood on what I'm telling and why I'm telling this here. Now it's all depend on you son how can you consider this problem as my personal or mental problem or think about it. The Road Tax. We all know about the vehicle registration policy. It's okay that different state have different registration charges. But tell me one thing. TN allows other state vehicle to run in their TN for one complete year whereas Karnataka allows other state vehicle to run in KA only for 1 month. Why? These all state permits are different why not same? It would have been better if tax is paid to central government at once and more hassle free. But within India you have to get NOC and also pay other life time road tax to the place you moving on. Don't you feel something wired ? Like these there are several kinds of tax .if challan or penalties can be the same everywhere in India why not the tax? If you ride without helmet ,1k fine in every state. Right? We aren't so stupid paying different tax to government? HINDI is national language. I'm not telling government to impose Hindi on every Indian citizen.once I was travelling in bus at karnataka and the bus conductor yelled me something in kanada and I didn't understand single word .My friend who was knowing little kanada told me what the bus conductor told “if you don't know kanada language don't come to our state go back to your state” . At the point I felt like I need to come back to India. Not only the government play much politics but also the people. Literally it's too much.If you feel I'm wrong then start travelling to south if you are from north and to no6if you are from south and please don't pay to get hospitality. Criticising other poor states and its people. One of my friend is from Bihar and literary he stopped introducing himself as from Bihar. He told me that people really criticise him and his poor state for no reason. Why do we do this? If India is a single country don't you think we need to stop such kind of shit. One thing I forgot to mention if you are pretty girl from anywhere in India you will be respected. Until you are a pretty girl none want you.you know what I'm talking about? Right? In my collage there are two girls from Bihar one is good at looks and the other girl good at life .No one tells anything bad to 1st one not even about her state,why? But whereas to the other girl , she really suffers .Now don't say its natural behaviour and all that shit .It may be natural to behave good with pretty ones but behaving like shit if one is not pretty is not at all natural. It's not going to just end . I don't want to type and waste my time cause until you experience these stuff you will not understand. And like this there are so many issues which make it feel like India is a subcontinent with 29 countries.

But in my opinion start with Warangal than Surathkal than Trichy. The reason for putting Trichy in the last because it doesn't allow students to go for Internship. And internship plays a huge role. Because Internship gives you a chance to get Pre Placement Offer. After getting PPO your tension for Placements will be released. As there is no big difference between these NITs you can take any. Although Placements will be more or less same. Only point You can skip Placement process by getting PPO. Which will help You save your precious time and enjoy the college life. Trichy doesn't allow MTech students to go for internship. While other two NITs does allow. So all are equally good. Hope this helps.

If one is not truly dedicated to academics, mechanical may become hell for them because this branch have some of strict professors among all other branches. Now coming to the answer, this year (2020) 118 out of 163 (some of them aren't eligible to sit in placements because of very less CGPA) students has been placed. Percentage is 72.39%. But around 60% of the placed students are offered from non core companies which is a common scenerio in all other institutes in India. Last year's placement percentage was 80%+. This year's percentage has some effects of corona virus pandemic cause college is closed 1.5 months before. These datas are from B.Tech. placements. If you are in NITK that is already one of best opportunities. Department has a few very good professors. Contradiction is also there. You can do various projects under them and their PhD scholars. Some profs has few connections with IISc, IITB and IITM , so sometimes it helps to get internships. Every year 4–5 top students from mechanical select in DAAD and Mitacs scholarship for foreign internships. Even few of my seniors were selected in US and German universities for higher studies. Department also have some of good, heavy and advanced machines and equipments in labs. Apart from department, there are numerous clubs to help building your skills. Baja NITK Racing , NITK Racing Club, Society of Automotive Engineers NITK, Robocon NITK, Flying and Robotics Club NITK are some good opportunities for Mechanical Engineering students. 2–3 from Baja and Racing club are placed every year in Bajaj Auto. CSD (Centre for System Design) is something truly a best opportunity in NITK. It is for students from all branches. Numerous numbers of projects including both intitutional and industrial can be seen in CSD NITK. Though most of these projects are being done by M.tech and PhD students, B.Tech students also can take up projects by asking to CSD in-charge prof. This is my review.

NITs owe their existence to a focus on technical education as mandated by GoI, not management education. Quite a few of them have tried to diversify into management education, but none of them, including the top ones, have been able to make a mark in management education. The same is true for IITs. Except for IIT-B’s SJMSOM, most of the other IITs’ SoM hardly appear as candidates of choice for management education. These institutes have a very good pedigree in their core field and hence should ideally stay focused there. Diffusing focus and trying to do too many things at the same time often leads to such results. There is a difference between diversifying in an altogether different field which are not related, and risk management. In fact the risk of the institute’s reputation being impacted by this is much more than the other way round. If at all they have to diversify, there are a lot of specialised areas in the field of technology which they can enter and even excel. But management is not one of them, unless they have ample resources at their disposal and can set up the right environment. Sadly, that isn’t the case. And to top it, there already are established management schools such as the IIMs and others pan-India (FMS, ISB etc.) which have already occupied the available space, thus leaving very little room for the NIT/IITs to make a mark with their current state (they are struggling for resources to run their tech courses, so management education is a distraction something they can certainly do without, and instead utilise the already scarce resources in an optimum way for the betterment of technical courses they run).

I am stating the above assuming you are studying M.Tech to learn, not to get some job. If you wanted a job, there are other ways and if you are capable of getting admission to IITG you must be having a decent job in hand. Let me explain the last statement. From RVCE CSE 2020 batch (where my son studies), I know not of anyone going to join an IIT/IISc for Masters. Anyone of them capable of getting a Gate score to enter these would be having a 20L+ job offer to put it the least. They are planning to mainly go abroad immediately or after an year or so. In other words, GATE is not too low competitive to get a seat in IITG unless you are good; and if you are good you should have a decent job (10L+ at least). So if you want to pursue higher education, I assume it is to learn. To learn, you are miles ahead in IITG than in Surathkal. QED.

Honestly I could’ve gone anonymous to write this answer and I apologise in case anyone gets offended because but some things have to be said out irrespective of how they would look or how they would sound. Now I would assume by Technical Clubs you mean the 5 Exclusive Clubs in College. Often it seems like a big deal just being a part of one of these clubs and sometimes it is just blown enormously for no reason at all. I have seen more people being depressed about not getting selected to one of these clubs and suffering from High Levels of Impostor Syndrome than I can count. So TLD;R: No, if you are a part or not a part of any of these clubs it has absolutely no consequence to your career at all. You are a brilliant person if you have reached NITK and you will continue to remain so and no one can take that away from you! So while there are no consequences of not being a part of club, there are few advantages of being a part of them: Social Circle: Your social circle and your network will expand across different years both in senior as well as junior batches. You will know people across branches or departments with varied interests and will have a much easier way of having your first conversation with them as compared to others. Some of my close friends, mentors, mentees have come as a result of my association with IEEE NITK and while that is a reasonable point, most of my friends do not really belong to IEEE and have been part of other clubs or no clubs at all. > It’s important to note that while you will have several social circles in college, you need to decide for yourself if you want to add one more social circle to your college life or not.Project Funding: Clubs have a significant amount of funding from the college and from their parent organisation. So IEEE NITK for example, gets a decent amount of funding from their parent organisation, i.e. IEEE as well as from the college from the DSW Office. In addition there are several benefits that the parent organisation might have (ACM I believe sends people to the GHCI Conference). Does this mean there are absolutely no other means of funding in college? - No, there are several labs such as Center for System Design, specific Department Labs which work on several projects all around the year, find out your interest approach them/your professor with a proposal and start working on a project.Branding: This is unfortunately the most overrated attribute and I have no idea why it’s part of the advantages part, but yes you will see some form of awe from your friends if you are a part of one of the clubs. Honest answer, outside of college no one cares if you are part of any club for that matter. The work that you do as part of the club will definitely matter but being a part of the club is as good as a participation certificate, it’s worthless apart from the experience that you get out of it. > Also in case you see people thinking highly of themselves after getting into a certain club or not getting into one, kindly ignore such people and move and move ahead in your life. You have much better things to do than interacting with such people!I think that’s all that I can think of as of now. In case I do remember something else, I’ll add to it as well! Being a part of a club/venture/company is a great feeling and definitely and achievement but not being part of something or getting rejected doesn’t mean you aren’t good enough. Just means you need to improve on few things to get there and you will one day. Every one has their own journeys which they need to undertake and you will reach there at one point!

Your decision hinges on the following: If you are passionate about engineering:If you love hardware more than software, then the choice is very clear, you must go to NIT Suratkal. However if you like software more than hardware, then the choice is also very clear go to RVCE.If you are not passionate about engineering:If you’re just doing engineering cause you have two seats at two good colleges in hand, then i’d suggest you choose CSE over EEE and go to RVCE, because EEE is a harder branch than CSE. You can study the day before for a CSE exam and score much much better than you can over an EEE exam. Also CSE provides great job security for someone who’s doing engineering for the heck of it. So CSE is easier then EEE, and this will leave you time to pursue things you think you truly might be passionate about. Also RVCE curriculum will be easier than NITK curriculum.That being said, if you want to have the experience of going to a national university in India situated on the beach and you dont mind studying a harder branch, then NIT is waiting for you. Note, however that the hostel facilities and all other infrastructure is as bad, or as good as RVCE. So it all depends on whether you want to study in a semi urban area, (a college on a beach!) or an urban area (RVCE is not in central Bangalore, but you definitely can explore Bangalore if you’re not from here), and if you want to get away from your parents and experience living on your own (I’m just assuming you live in Bangalore, my bad if you don’t live in Bangalore, then you’ll experience living alone anyway).If you’re still extremely unsure about what to do after reading the above then hell, just flip or coin, or listen to your mum, ’cause mum’s are rarely wrong.

Following is a lengthy answer but i don’t have an option. This is my first answer in Quora. But my honest answer might be helpful for somebody while making a decision. I will cover few of the important parameters which one looks while choosing a business school. Faculty All faculty have Phd but their teaching quality is pathetic. You will wonder how come people with such low caliber teach at a institute of national importance. Mainly this course has survived just for the sustenance of large group of “good for nothing” faculty. The slides currently used by faculty are from the period 2006–2009 which they used for the first batch. This shows how updated they are. No case studies are taught, even if they do so, they are outdated. Faculty expect only bookish words and requires research work in any project submission. Even if you do an Internship in the field of finance or operation, they require a research report which you need to bluff. Syllabus The syllabus used by the department is archaic which has got nothing do with current corporate requirement. Repeated efforts by the students to update the curriculum did not yield any positive outcome. Instead of acknowledging the drawbacks HOD and others claim this as IIM standard!. Infrastructure The current class room of MBA was earlier an electrical lab. Department has got no separate building. Its better I don’t talk about the seating arrangement. You will be allotted 8th block hostel which ranks lowest in both hygiene and maintenance (For boys). Placement Placement scenario is worst. There are local colleges such as Sahyadri Institute, St. Aloysius, SDM Institute of Management etc which have better placements. In many instances companies have approached offering 10–15K/month. Placement for MBA is purely dependent on the student placement coordinators of the batch. No faculty is bothered to support or help in placement process. Most top companies do not show interest to hire from SOM NITK for its outdated curriculum and since it does not come under any Tier (Such as Tier 1, 2). Minimum package: 3 LPA Maximum packege: 7.5 LPA (Rarely, once in blue moon) Median Package: When you can count people placed by fingers why you need it. Management and few of the old students like Mr. Beryl Thomas have the habit of promoting false placement statistics. As other person has answered, even if a person gets a job such as IBPS, management claims as its achievement. Selection Process College uses CAT and GMAT scores, but i request them to use either PGCET or their own exam than degrade the brand name for these two. You can find person with 90%le to 10%le. The situation has become such that you just need a CAT/GMAT score. From 2016 they even reduced bachelor degree requirement from 60% to 50%. The GD and PI are nothing but just a formality. This does not stop at this, they even have a spot admission where one can come with CAT score and get the seat!. But in-spite all these circus they are able to fill only 30–40 out of 64 seats. [PS: If you just take CAT and dont attempt any question you will get 55%le] So just don’t go by the Facebook page or PagalGuy where you will find 5* ratings, all is well talks.

P.S If you are Interested in doing PhD, this is the best place for you! If not you get the crap out of this teaching and syllabus, outdated presentation slides, complete research oriented study, many have no idea what they do infact!)This particular department doesn't have any industry partnership with any of the firm, no relationship building initiation is undertaken. How do you expect the companies to come in search of you and give you the jobs?They never applied for ranking of the institute as well, companies go according to the ranking, in terms of campus placements.The companies couldn't understand if we are in Tier 1 or Tier 2 or left without any tier. The company do not show Interest in recruiting you. (Especially your dream companies)Even if the company visits, the pay ranges from 2.5 - 4 (Exactly where the majority gets job. 7.5–8 (happens to some, through their own references)To conclude, If you are looking forward to work on research, literature reviews, do a PhD these faculties are good to support and guide you. But to mold yourself into a right MBA candidate, you get to learn nothing. If you are looking for a good job to settle, this is seriously not the right place to join.

Also, IT of IIIT A is too good among best in country. Now, coming to your question, it depends on you that which branch you want to take as EEE and CSE of different colleges cannot be compared. If you like electrical sort of thing then go for EEE and if you like coding then go for CSE. It should be completely your choice that which branch will you take.

Students of IIITG hardly have any time during semester , but NIT pace is much more relaxed. IIITG doesn't have any big fest , but NIT Silchar has mega events. You decide which to choose , of course. IIITG has dedicated coding classes by a top notch Asst. Professor/ alumnus of IIITH on every Sunday for 3 hours . This is unheard of in NITS. Etc etc. So I think ( subject to your own decision of course ) that I would do as follows if I were in your place : If Advanced rank is not good , see if JEE Mains rank gives me IIITH/ IIITD/IIITA. (If I am a cat in coding , I wouldn't look beyond these top IIITs for CSE from JEE Mains perspective). If I am not a coding cat, then NITT/W for CSE due to impeccable pedigree. (If AIR permits of course, since these are top colleges from JEE Mains) . And if coding talent is not identified in school days due to lack of special interest in CS( which happens even to a lot of top rankers), NITT /W/S etc are any day better for the non-coding CSE student than the top IIITs which are more hardcore in nature for CSE. (* A person not having interest in coding would be lost in IIITH. Not necessarily a desirable thing. So if I would avoid IIITH and choose an IIT of low rank or an NIT of top rank , no one would blame me. My career would still be ok. Though Google Mountain View would never happen of course. )Now to your main question.

I had the exact same options and I understand how nerve-racking it may be to choose between these three amazing colleges, so let me try to simplify a little bit. It all depends on you. If you are a resident of Bangalore, and don’t want to go to hostel, RV is the one for you. It is a well-reputed college and the fact that you got CSE (hotly contested,ay?) means that you are in safe hands; the professors are great(At least that’s what I heard) and so is the college; you will enjoy the indoor basketball court if that’s your thing, while being surrounded by (mostly) like-minded individuals who aced KCET. But, bear in mind a few things. RV may not be how that one uncle on the street told you it will be. Don’t get me wrong, I have nothing against RV; it was indeed my dream college for many years. I’m talking about Management Quota. No matter what the college may proclaim, Management seats are sold like hot cakes(because it’s RV(read: aaarvee). This very popularity and cult following leads to its downfall. If you are ready for hostel, all three look promising,right? Let’s explore: If you want to do Computer Science and Computer Science ONLY, then don’t think that RV is your only option. IIIT-B’s first TWO YEARS has predominantly common syllabus for both; CSE and ECE(in iMtech). We sit together and learn programming and computer architecture. You also can do branch change by getting on the Dean’s Merit List. No reserved seats here for branch change. Your performance alone speaks volumes here. NIT-K EEE is also no doubt a great choice, but if you don’t want to do anything apart from CSE/IT, branch change is a big risk. You see, branch change follows a few rules, like- Your current branch strength must not decrease by more than 10%Your future branch strength must not increase by more than 10%Category-wise allotment of seats takes place, similar to JoSAA.Also, number of free seats are very low, and reservation makes it lower still. Look, I am not condemning reservation(in fact, it is good, but it is sadly misused-hence the conflicts) or anything, I’m just saying it’s much much harder to do Branch Change in NIT-K. If you are interested in Higher Studies: IIIT-B is the clear winner here. We have a superb iMtech program here, where you get two degrees(B.Tech and M.Tech) in the space of 5 years, instead of 6(4-B.Tech+2-M.Tech). In other colleges, you would have triple tension: Studying to maintain a good CGPAStudying PlacementsStudying for GATE(another JEE in itself(we don’t need reminding how competitive JEE is))Also, after you complete your four years, you face a very difficult trade-off: Job or higher studies? IIIT-B kills two birds with one stone; you get two degrees AND no need to apply for GATE. What I would suggest is not to think about “wasting an extra year studying instead of working” but how you can learn more in less time. The former opinion is held by a surprising number of people, who don’t seem to realise that a college is more than just placements. Which brings us to our next topic: Placements. I’ll let the numbers do the talking. Placement Statistics-IIITB R V College of Engineering-RVCE The EEE placements are notoriously hard to find, but I can tell some approximate numbers that I found after comparing statistics from other Core Branches(e.g Chemical) and answers on Quora, Shiksha etc. Placement % =~95 Average salary package = ~9,00,000 INR Here also, IIITB has the upper hand. It’s location plays a major role. Bangalore is a major IT hub and electronics city is the prime location. With Infosys (literally) a stone’s throw away and numerous other companies very close by, IIIT-B has become a big shot in industry. Also helping it is the fact that there is no reservation/management quota, so everyone is on the same learning curve. What I think is the most important parameter here, is next: Learning Outcomes. The curriculum and electives at IIIT-B is undoubtedly the best. Not many colleges recognise the interdependence of ECE and CSE , like IIIT-B does. As an ECE student, you become not the jack of all trades, but the master of all trades. You learn both concepts; CSE and ECE. And the quality of faculty needs no explaining. Have a look at it yourself: Faculty(IIITB) The labs are well-equipped and the library is excellent. You are taken care of, academically. While NITK has professors like IR Rao, you just can’t argue with the overall quality of faculty at IIIT-B. Hostels: You will stay here for the next 4(or 5) years. Having seen NIT-K and RVCE hostels and having lived in IIIT-B hostels, IIIT-B hostels are far better than the other two. Age is the reason for this, although all the facilities exist in all three colleges, they are better maintained in IIIT-B. Age has taken its toll on the other two. Also, the prime location of IIIT-B means that everything is just a stone’s throw away(not just Infosys). Verdict: It’s pretty clear. According to me, IIIT-B is the better option for you. It wins on almost all parameters listed above. But then again, you are joining a college, not me. So, here’s what I suggest you to do. Make an excel sheet and list out all the colleges you can joinDo your research. Intensive research. Know every detail about each college.List out all the parameters you feel are important. Not just campus size or highest placement package. Step out of that narrow mindset. Campus is not everything(Although all colleges have great campuses) and you will get highest salary package if and only if you work hard, not just because your college has a high number in that regard.People on the street must not have a high importance (although all three colleges are good, peoples’ eyes will pop out when you say you got RV). You do your research and you decide.You should have at least 15–20 parameters. Then, score them in an unbiased manner out of 10(say.)Choose the college with a higher number, and feel convinced with your choice. After all, you are studying, not anyone else.That’s how I joined here, in the amazing IIIT-B. If you do join here, be assured that there is no ragging, seniors are very helpful and kind.

Shoaib was my friend’s room mate in PG hostel and used to say different incidents that happened in kashmir valley. He was once so disturbed when he came to know that his brother, who used to stay in kashmir was beaten up by some people who are pro- azad kashmir. The same day there was a conference going in seminar hall of civil engineering department. When one of the professors during his explanation said something like “ These walls can be constructed in kashmir as well and they can with stand bullets”. My disturbed friend shoaib just stood up and yelled “ It's because of people like you kashmir is not in peace”. The whole seminar hall was shocked. We don't know what would happen next, because a student shouting at a experienced professor is not a common scene. What happened next was a beautiful thing. Our then NITK director “swapan bhattacharya” apologized for using kashmir as an example for war zone, even the professor apologized. The professors consoled him for what has happened to his brother in kashmir and money was sent to his family from the college funds for the hospital expenses and education of his elder brother. Now I am happy to say shoaib is working for water works department of J&k state. His brother is working for a software firm in Bangalore. I am still friends with shoaib and we chat ocassionally on Facebook. So I can say with pride that NIT-k is always pro students, we don't see any violence and the institutions of national importance should produce more engineers like shoaib who can change the environment of kashmir valley with development and education.

There is no one who really cares about your faculty feedback. These kinda prof. are not expected in a college of national importance. My rating on faculty is 3.25/5. Lab equipment and infrastructure : Labs are quite good and helpful for the students. Infrastructure is kinda Average. No AC's, elevators most of the time won't work. Very old buildings. My rating is 3.75/5. Research : If you are interested in research then NITK CE is like paradise. NITK has the best laboratories. Profs are really helpful and encouraging ( 70% of profs). They will guide you in various things from how to write a front page of paper to how to present a paper or thesis. There are many scholarship programs and you can also work at foreign universities. My rating is 4/5. Placements : Placements at NITK Surathkal CE are not bad when compared to other institutes. About 70+% of eligible students gets placed (core + non core). If you want placement in non-core companies then there many companies which are open for civil students with min. CGPA 6 - 7+. If you want placement in core companies, you need to be in top 40 ( CGPA - 8+). If you have CGPA 8.7 + then there is more possibility you will get placed. Some top construction companies like L and T constructions comes for placement and recruit around 15 students with average package around 6 lpa. If you want get placed in PSU's you need luck. PSU's will come for campus placements only if there any vacancies in that particular year. You need good CGPA like 9+ to get placed and package is 15+ lpa. One thing I wanna tell you is that getting good pointers in NITK, civil is very easy. Only thing that needed is occasional studying. My rating is 3.75/5. Summary : In my opinion, studying CE in NITK Surathkal is good when compared to other NIT's or even some IIT's. The faculty issue is almost similar in every college. The friends you make in this process are invaluable and ofcourse it is the only college in India with a dedicated private beach. So give it a shot!

I have many friends in COE who have left many top nit cs and one of my friend even left IIITH cs for NSIT coe(though I would not suggest that).

So given the fact you have the required knowledge, you can enter in your dream companies with the dream package. And also there are quite good places to visit around the college which may not be the case in the other two colleges. 2.Placements I think it is the thing which makes NSIT choice of some top rankers. Placements, especially of COE are superb because of which it’s cutoff are so high. Plus I don't know why but there is some serious coding culture in here. You would find students of even mpae doing coding here. Every fourth or fifth person has a bag of coding ninjas here :p. 3. Various institutes In Delhi there are various institutes for exams like GRE/CAT/GATE. Apart from these there are various top coding institutes like coding ninjas, blocks, pepcoding etc. Due to these institutes, students here become quite skilled and it helps them to have good packages and clear above mentioned exams. 4.Home advantage Here you have an advantage that you can enjoy your hostel life and also not miss your home much. So it becomes really convineient especially during exams as we can give them from home. Personally I feel that home is the best place where you can focus on your studies and your future plans. At the end I would like to say that college matters upto a certain level only and after that only your skills matter.  Do comment below if you have any further doubts.

The reasons are following. It is not like you are comparing new IIT and NIT Surathkal. You are comparing IIT Guwahati which is one of the older IITs. IIT Guwahati alumni base is much stronger than NIT Surathkal. If you take an example of Samsung. One of my friend working their he completely described the work culture. He told if you are from IIT whether it's new or old Samsung people treat you like God. But even if you are from Trichy, Warangal or Surathkal they just don't give a damn. They believe in IIT tag. Other thing is the reputation and social status. You will gain more respect in the society. People see you with different eyes. As if you came as an angel from the heaven. Other thing is the Campus of IIT Guwahati. It is one of the most most beautiful campus in India. You will fell in love with it believe me. The other thing is you will have great chance to study with some of the most talented undergrads which you won't find in NIT. The other thing is there are so many companies which don't prefer to visit NIT. But definitely visits older IITs. Some companies like Qualcomm do not open R&d profiles in NITs but opens in older IITs. Like wise there are several companies which differentiate between the packages offered at NIT and IITs older ones. Like CISCO offers 39 lacs in IIT and in NIT it offers 31. So like wise there are many. I hope I have given you many reasons to choose IIT Guwahati over NIT Surathkal or Some other NIT. If you would have asked me IIT Hyderabad VS NIT Surathkal, Trichy, Warangal I should have said go with NITs. But in case of IIT Guwahati VS NITs you should definitely go with IIT Guwahati.

IEEE which the best and you should work hard to go through their really tough process. Other clubs level is so low that they need not be mentioned also. But still if you want to ruin your life by going into these club then ok (they are acm, iste, ie, iet(so useless that am not using uppercase for them). But still you can atleast look for acm (better than other 3). Now if you really want to gain knowledge and want to excel in your passionate field then go for IEEE accordingly (means they have sigs related to cs, electrical, mechanical). And a good advice from senior after IEEE (if you are not getting it) Go for non exclusive like web club, BAJA, Nitk Racing. There you will find real passionate people. Now coming to recruitment process IEEE is toughest and only exclusive club to maintain their legacy. About other clubs acm process is very easy for you if you know some seniors into it, they don't care if u are talented or not just party system prevails there, and they just waste your time but still find some great seniors there to guide and help you. About iste (their recruitment process is worst in nitk damn opaque, sometimes you would be knowing more than the interviewer, it is most biased club of nitk and knowing senior definately guarantees your place in their club, here even if you have given test well still you won't get selected. Because first they select their own people then if some seats are left then some of u might be lucky to proceed for the further round. Their reputation is very low and they are 2nd worst organised club in nitk. Then comes ie actually it is way better than iste but for the past many years people have the misconception that iste is better. Actually their full selection process is very transparent but what they lack is good bunch of people who are willing to join them. Most of the time people join them if they haven't got anything. So that lack of will environment prevails here. Then iet they are underdogs in all the clubs nobody cares about them. Then comes non exclusive clubs. Nitk racing, Baja, Web club they all are well organised, full transparency is there in selection procedure and they believe in work is worship. So i would recommend you to go in the following sequence. IEEE WEB CLUB/NITK RACING /BAJA ACM Stop here if you really want to learn something. Because it's not like seniors will help only if you are in club just be aware of what is happening in the club through your any friend(if unfortunately u were not able to make into these) and keep working on it yourself and keep asking seniors. Just want to add a line in your cv and for that want to waste time of entire 3 years then acm ie iste iet. I hope i have answered in such a way that you will find it easy to choose clubs.

This has happened a lot while going back to college via train from Delhi to Mangalore. NIT Surathkal is popularly known as Holy Trinity of NITs (NIT Trichy, Surathkal and Warangal) Coming to your question, Although both are amazing colleges, I still believe that there is a good difference between NIT Surathkal and NIT Surat. Assuming all parameters like Infrastructure, Faculty, Other Facilities being equivalent in both NIT Surathkal and NIT Surat. Let us look at a few parameters which could be a differentiator for Students: Placement FiguresNIRF RankingMedian SalaryJEE Cut-offCampus and Private Beach (yes, you read it correct) Parameter 1: Placement Figures Based on official 2018 placement report, NIT Surathkal[1] is able to place more than 90% of its UG eligible students while NIT Surat[2] is able to place only 73% of its eligible UG students.NIT Surathkal is a clear winner here by a large margin.  Parameter 2: NIRF Ranking NIRF Ranking Framework: Graduation outcomes check placement statics, higher studies, and entrepreneurship, the median salary of placed students, how many graduating students admitted into top universities and number of Ph.D. students graduated Among NITs Ranking 2019 by NIRF released by MHRD[3] , NIT Surathkal is ranked 3rd while NIT Surat is ranked 12th among all NITsOverall, NIT Surathkal is ranked at 21 while NIT Surat is ranked at 58 among Top 200 Engineering Colleges in India.The overall ranking is low because of low ratings on Outreach & Inclusivity and overall perception.NIT Surathkal is ranked 2nd among all NITs in Perception among employers and academic arena. Parameter 3: Median Salary NIT Surathkal is ranked 2nd after NIT Warangal (Overall rank among Top 200 colleges is 26th) among all NITs in median salary[4] Parameter 4: JEE Cut off Score Let us look at previous year JEE Mains Cut-off[5] for most preferred branch among engineering aspirants. Here is the CS cut-off for 2017:  Based on JEE-Cut off, NIT Surathkal seems to be a clear winner against NIT Surat. Please note that there might be a possibility this cut-off might change slightly for different years.  Parameter 5: Campus and Private Beach Both campuses are pretty huge in terms of area (in acres). NIT Surathkal is spread across 295+ acres while NIT Surat is spread across 250+ acres. The National Institute of Technology, Karnataka (Surathkal) is probably the only college in India that has its own private beach, including a lighthouse. What else do you need?[6] Beautiful Campus in the Country: NIT Surathkal is among Top 10 beautiful campus in the country across all domains (Engineering, Management, etc)  The NITK Beach during INCIDENT'17[7] (Cultural Festival) Kite Festival. Not too much of boasting for NIT Surathkal, but, as per www.collegedekho.com, Cultural festival of NIT Surathkal i.e. Incident is ranked 2nd after Mood Indigo (IIT Bombay) in the country.  Last, but not least, both NIT Surathkal and NIT Surat are amazing engineering campuses in the country, and dream of millions of engineering aspirants who are writing JEE every year to get into these campuses. P.S: I have tried to be as unbiased as possible but there might be certain biases being an alum of NIT Surathkal (as it is natural for anyone). If you feel so, please let me know. I will try to correct it as soon as possible.

For other branches, industrial internship is usually difficult, although your professors can recommend you somewhere better. I can give you insights about B.Tech students also, which I gathered during my first year of masters.

So getting even chemical or production in i would say top 10 NITs its worth. Rest nits are not so worth u can choose your home state private n u can get a better branch When you would check for college then just check no.of clubs , co-curricular activites,college reputation , n how you would be after 4 yrs . Just work on your personal development. 2-IF YOU R IN MYTH OF DOING MBA Yeah you would be confused what i want to say . By this i mean that every btech passout just thinks for a mba. Buts thats not necessary. Taste changes in your 4 yrs of this crutial life. N at the end u will be messed up with lower branches because doing mba from top iim , foreign universities is worth which is somewhat hard to get. So i want to say that there should be backup plan for each n every step of life… so i think IT sector can save you from the ups n downs of life…like if u r good in studies in your btceh n if your college is not one of the nits you can still make it large !!! You can freely just sitting at home can apply for jobs .

617,617,National-Institute-of-Technology-Karnataka-Surathkal-3,I have heard that NTA has messed up the rank and percentile system. Will this affect any opening or closing ranks of getting into the best NITs like Trichy Warangal Surathkal and Calicut in any way?,5,1,5/1,Yes,Followed,2019-05-14,https://www.quora.com/I-have-heard-that-NTA-has-messed-up-the-rank-and-percentile-system-Will-this-affect-any-opening-or-closing-ranks-of-getting-into-the-best-NITs-like-Trichy-Warangal-Surathkal-and-Calicut-in-any-way,"TLDR; Closing ranks for top NITs will get affected IF due to normalisation the JEE Mains ranks by a large margin did not accurately reflect the ranks the students ideally deserved (which Advanced most certainly will). I am not sure to what extent NTA has messed up score vs ranks this year. The opening and closing ranks for NITs are dependent on students’ ranks in advanced. You can assume that the top 500 rankers in JEE Mains would likely get top ranks in advanced as well. Unpredictability lies mainly in JEE Mains Rank 1000 and upwards bracket. For the previous years, you could generalise that a good number of top 3000 students in JEE Mains would perform equally well in JEE advanced and go to the IITs. This year you cannot be sure that would be the case (thank you, NTA). For instance, depending on the extent of the mess up, students in JEE Main Rank Bracket 5000- 10000 could have very well deserved to be in the top 5000 ranks in Mains, but due to all the normalisation, they did not. Those students might end up getting the ranks they deserve in advanced. This will imply that closing ranks for the top NITs would get affected. Take this with a pinch of salt because all of what I’ve written is based on what I have read/ heard from many candidates - that the JEE Mains system this year has been unfair to the well deserving ones. Give it your all for Advanced - who knows, maybe you’ll not even have to think of the top NITs! Good luck!

It's gonna be all new for every one. Now let's have a look over previous years cutoff, for general category. Year State OR CR No of rounds of counselling 2016 HS 329 3130 6 2016 OS 266 1246 2017 HS 306 5173 7 2017 OS 666 2340 2018 HS 928 3928 7 2018 OS 278 1767 ( I think Quora should have a table feature in its editor :p). Credit of low cutoff in 2017 goes to that years paper, simplest in the history of JEE Mains. So by the data analysis of above trend, one can easily set a bar of 1500-1700 rank for OS and 3500 rank for HS in order to get a seat in CSE branch. Ranking of NITK from 2016–2018 has also improved.

There you will learn real computer science which is not in graduation. You will have real skills after CDAC-DAC and 100% placement without any doubt.

I answer anonymously because I am a faculty in engineering college and I don’t want my seniors, HOD, Dean will create any problem for me and I don't want someone made same mistake as I did. My sincere advise is avoid M.Tech and prefer the job. If you really want M.Tech than prefer old IIT >> IIIT >> few NIT.

I was a B Tech student so I don’t too many details about the PG programme, but I took a few PG courses which were offered in our third and final year so, I’ll answer the questions based on that. In the years, one year is full of courses and one year is mainly dedicated to a project with a minimal number of courses. The E&C department is one of the most hardworking and fairest departments in my opinion. The results are proportional to your effort. The curriculum is completely in the hands of the lecturer but generally, go deeper than the UG equivalent. The courses can be hectic if you are not used to it. There will be a course project for most of the courses and you will have to put in the effort yourself beyond college hours. For example, I had taken a DSP architecture elective which carried only 3 credits but we had a lab after college hours and a course project but the MIMO communication course did not have anything extra. Like any college, there are some really good teachers and some not as great ones. The good thing is that there are resources which are dedicated for use of the PG students. In the end, it is your initiative that will define how much benefit you get from it. Now, coming to point of placements… Most of the companies are open to both UG and PG students but the number of core companies that come are few and far in number. It may be beneficial to apply off campus simultaneously as you may find better opportunities if you are looking for something in core industry. The CTC offered is generally not different from the UG students. There are some exceptions. For example, Qualcomm which hired both UG and PG students gave a different starting designation The ratio of UG students hired is higher than PG students. So, who will benefit from it? -> If you graduated from a non-premier institute and believe that graduating from a premier institute will boost your resume -> If you want jobs in a core industry which hires PG degree holders (which are very few in number, eg ISRO) but you’ll have to apply off campus. -> If you are interested in research and are willing to put the effort (yourself) I hope this perspective helps ",0.257836,Positive,3.515672,0.06451612903225806,1,4.515672,3.515672

Make sure to have 75 percent attendance. 5. Friends teach you more than professors. 6. Going to various colleges for competitions is the best part. My team went to IIIT Allahabad and we won the second prize in the dance competition.  7. An engineering college is not done without technicality. You will get the opportunity to join various robotics, aeromodelling, automotive ,coding ,etc clubs and learn new concepts and show your innovation. 8.Exams have the worst scenario ever. People do wake up the entire night for the preparation. However it's all about how fast you grasp the topics. 9. Never mess up with the professors. If they will have any personal grudges against you, they can ruin your career. 10.Fests are the best part of college .It keeps you busy as well entertaining throughout the day. From technical and cultural events to DJ nights, you will learn and enjoy everything.  11. POINTER IS IMPORTANT. Not only it adds to your resume but also gives you respect among your peers. 12. Birthdays are celebrated in the best way you could have ever imagined. Everything is planned from cake , gifts to decorations keeping everything confidential and when you happily cut the cake ,your face will be dumped into it followed by gpl.  13. As soon as your exams will be over, the entire city will know about it because none of your friends will be found in their room and to whichever restaurant or movie theater you will go, you will find one of your friends who ditched your plan and is sitting with someone else. 14.You will make friends with whom you had never even imagined. Try everything but don't fall into the wrong hands.These years will be the golden years of your life. 15.

Having a good CGPA does not guarantee a good placement, it merely provides better opportunities and makes you eligible to apply for better companies. Once the application is done, it is all dependent on your knowledge and intelligence to secure a placement. Having said that, most of the good companies visiting the campus have a CGPA cutoff of 7, sometimes even 7.5. At the same time, a CGPA of, say 7.1, does not look that attractive on your resume. When compared to other students, there is an instinctive feeling that you are probably not as good as others. There is a high chance that the interviewer will look for points in the interview/resume to reject you (On the other hand, for a student with CGPA 9+, the interviewer will look for points to select him/her). So, in order to be eligible for most of the companies and stay within the positive thoughts of the interviewer, a CGPA of 8+ would be decent enough.

I will assume that you may have got 5 in worst case. So I suggest by keeping this in mind. Here it starts, First of all the first year of engineering is not at all usefull according to me. If you got good CGPA means it will boost your overall CGPA or vice versa. But you don't need to worry much about it, as past is past we can't able to change it. So when you come to the ground reality I had seen many of my friends who scored 5 SGPA not only in first year but also 5 SGPA in second year scored 9.8 SGPA or the other way round in third and and final years. Here comes the trickest part that how some people scored so good SGPA with such a poor performance in first two years. First year and second year of Electrical and electronics doesn't have any link.In three months vacation atmost just go through some OPAmps in electronics and basics of KCL and KVL. It will help you some basics.But if you miss this and you are already in second year means don't worry. You will be studying digital electronics and analog electronics. Concentrate on it.Now the most important thing that you have to do is just study hard. Aim to secure 9SGPA. I will tell you , it's very easy. Just follow the lectures and go through their study materials and its done. You are guaranteed. I personally did it. I had seen one of my friend who had 6 SGPA in first year, started studying and didn't bunk even single class in next three years studied sincerely and result is his SGPA jumped from 6 to 7 in Second year and 7 to 8 in third year and 8 to 9 in final year and he even secured 10 in two semesters.

I could have chosen Manipal at that time but I was not getting CSE, rather IT. Even I feel, that taking IT in Manipal would have been a better choice…anyways leave it. My mains was good but my board %age was $hit so I wasn’t getting any decent NIT. Now coming to Manipal, I think it is a very good college. Some of my senior friends have graduated from Manipal. I know some 4–5 people and all of them are working in top class companies like Microsoft, Amazon, VMware etc. 3 of them are planning to move to US after an year or so to try for Google and facebook. So, I feel that Manipal is also producing very good quality engineers and frankly speaking, I don’t think it is much of a step down from BITS or NIT, especially when you are getting CSE in it’s main campus. I think if you have decent GPA (my friends were like 7.8, 8.1, 7.9, 8.7 type pointers), you can get something very good in your life. Take an informed decision, choose whichever combination you like.

The hardest one to get is Computer Science, for which you will need to maintain a CGPA of 8+ in your first year. This is not hard if you are focused. You can read my answer on how to get a good first year CGPA at BITS for more information. Pros of this option: BITS is the most reputed out of the 3 options you mentioned. The BITS tag does have advantages.Universities abroad recognize BITS, IITs and some NITs and you stand slightly better chances of getting an MS admit, if that’s what you go for later on.BITS alumni network is very strong. You’ll get referrals in top companies and shared accommodation in several cities in India and abroad for your internships and such.BITS promotes all-round development of an individual.You will have an awesome college life, both on campus and off-campus. It’s Goa.You get another year to think about your interests, review your B.E. options and decide which one you want to opt for. This way you can also get CS which has the highest demand as it offers some of the best opportunities in the future.Cons of this option: Taking up a dual degree means you will need 5 years to graduate, as opposed to 4 years for single degree.This can be taken in a positive way also. The final (fifth) year is not spent on campus. You can do 6 months of internship in an industry related to your B.E. degree and 6 months of thesis (undergraduate research work) either in India or abroad related to your M.Sc. degree (you will have to secure these on your own merit, but most dual degree students with an aim in life do manage to get good opportunities in their fifth year.)If you want Chemical Engineering as your B.E. degree four your dual, even a CGPA of 5 will do (I don’t mean any offense to Chemical Engineering students - two of my best friends and some of the best minds I’ve seen in college are Chemical Engineering students - they get great opportunities too, if they put in the effort). But if you want the options which are more in-demand such as Computer Science, you will need to work to get an 8+ CGPA. As I mentioned before, it’s not that hard, but it isn’t particularly easy either. You can’t say, “I’ve passed my +2. Now my hard-work days are over”.If I were you, I would go for a dual degree in BITS. IMO, it’s the best choice. But don’t make a decision in haste. Think about it. Weigh the pros and cons I mentioned above and then make your call. Hope this helps. ",0.28218,Positive,3.5643599999999998,0.06451612903225806,1,4.56436,3.5643599999999998

The reason is that these NITs have been given the tag ‘Institutions of National Importance’ and that is the catch. MHRD has been too liberal in sanctioning faculty positions much in excess of what is required and the teaching work load of these faculty is less than 10 h per week on an average. The faculty on the other hand imagine that they are not required to teach the undergraduates and off load their teaching assignments to the research students or even M.Tech students. Unfortunately, the faculty have not been able to do well in their research activity also going by the number and quality of publications. The other factors that count to improve their ranking are also not easily taken care of by the NITs. As a result, the main activity of teaching-learning process suffers. With the kind of academic freedom they have, they are able to manipulate the success rate of UG output and continue to survive. Drastic measures are needed from MHRD and UGC to look into and evaluate these institutions realistically and address the issues firmly if we have to expect any improvement in the quality of engineering education.

I have spent 3 years at Center for system design, hence I feel I can give you some insightful information about the centre. Center for system design is an interdisciplinary centre of NITK surathkal, working to build and test systems of any field (mechanical, electronic, electrical, civil, computer science etc). The centre is mainly focused to develop a lab which can be operated from any place of the world and it is funded directly by central government (MHRD). Also, there are plenty of other projects going on at the centre of various domains. I was fortunate enough to be a part of virtual lab project and I have contributed to the development of a few setups which you can visit from this link. (www.rtlabs.nitk.ac.in). In this project, there were students working from various disciplines such as electronics, mechanical, computer science etc. So you get to share the practical knowledge of your domain with another people to improve your understanding. Being a mechanical engineer, I never ever felt that I am just a mechanical engineer instead I used to handle the challenges of computer science and electronics domain as well. So you can now imagine the number of opportunities one can get to work in developing an end product. Also, this improves our imagination power to think beyond a limit. It is worth mentioning that the biggest thing which CSD offered me is to learn and explore yourself with the plenty of costly equipment’s available (facilities include any type of sensor, national instrument ADC, 3D printer, open source hardware, Laser cutting machine and many more). The centre is equipped with such a level of instruments that if you have any crazy idea running in your mind, it will not take you much time to experiment and test it. I feel that it’s one of the ideal places in the world to enhance your technical strength in the domain you are interested in it. I have tried my best to just give you a glimpse of the centre and I hope this will help you with some way. Feel free to write me for any queries.

When I was there, the overall placement statistics for the entire mechanical department in the master's stream was bit average. The actual numbers can be found on the institute website. M.Tech jobs are a bit had to come by since the companies would prefer hiring from a larger pool of BTech engineers who they can then mould per their requirements. The MTech folks become highly specialised and thus are suited only for niche roles. You do get internship opportunities in the final year of masters and these companies can offer you a job post your graduation. That's what happened to me and a few others. I was in Thermal Engineering, but it does not matter. Focus on getting good projects and additional qualifications like research papers on hot topics or a really nice and practical thesis is one of the things to keep in mind. Hope this helps.

Research bent : IIIT Bangalore ECE/CSE MBA: BITS CASE 2: If Fees is a problem (which is >20 Lakhs in both BITS and IIIT Bangalore) Join NIT Surathkal/Warangal Mechanical by tossing a coin, both have their pros and cons. Personally, I would prefer Surathkal because of the city connect. Personal Opinion: Don’t consider NITs as an option and join IIIT Bangalore if you don’t have any inclination towards Mechanical as IIIT Bangalore is catching up pretty fast with IIIT Hyderabad and has gained a lot of reputation in the Bengaluru Silicon Valley.

And all are nearly equal. Each having some pros and cons. You should choose one of them according to your choice of city and suitability. If suitability and selection of cities does not matter much to you then you should ask related people for the condition of department you are going to opt for your m.tech. Sometimes students want to join m.tech enthusiastically to do Phd and other higher courses so for them the department they are choosing should have an strict and serious impact regarding research. But sometimes they only join to get an atmosphere to prepare for govt jobs with the of govt aids. In that condition department should be lenient. Now choice is yours.

862,862,National-Institute-of-Technology-Karnataka-Surathkal-3,Are 220 marks in the JEE Mains enough to get into mechanical engineering at NITK Surathkal?,22,2,22/2,Yes,Followed,2018-07-19,https://www.quora.com/Are-220-marks-in-the-JEE-Mains-enough-to-get-into-mechanical-engineering-at-NITK-Surathkal,Its more than enough to get mechanical in one of the prestigious institution of india. In 2017 cut off was around 8000 and in 2018 was 7147 marks around 190. With 220 marks you can get eee as well which is better branch than mechanical in my opinion. But for now dont think of numbers concentrate on the basics and try to build up concepts.in the examination hall you have to be mentally strong so that you could execute your plans well otherwise even to score 200 in mains will be tough nut to crack. All the best for jee 2019. ,0.3446,Positive,3.6892,0.3548387096774194,1,4.6892,3.6892
