But during my admission days I had searched a lot about IIITs and me myself in one of the IIITs, I feel that IIITs are way lot better than the NITs. I am specifically talking about Mtech in VLSI. You can see the companies visiting the campus and their CTC. The syllabus also is much updated at IIITB and the faculites are having very good experience level in their subjects. Just one disadvantage it has over NIT is of fess and if this is a concern for you then the only NIT that somewhat matches IIITB (though it is not better than IIITB) is NITT.So, decide for yourself if you can make it for NITT. Rest NITs are not that good option for Mtech in VLSI. Hope it helps. ",0.090675,Positive,3.18135,0.009433962264150943,0,3.18135,3.18135

There is NO demand of such degree holders in the industry. Most of such degree holders remain jobless. Or are fired after the admission session ends in Indian engineering colleges. This happens because Indian engineering curriculum is 40 years old.

I had been working in a software company prior to joining IIITB. I was deeply interested and curious about programming and software development, and thus was planning for a M.Tech in CS related fields. Why I chose IIITB?  This might sound really really funny. I had a okayish Gate Score but in ECE stream. I was planning for a switch to any CS or IT related course. I searched the whole internet for such courses that accepts Gate ECE scores. These were very rare and few IITs offer such interdisciplinary courses and its in high demand too. One fortunate day, when I was searching for courses in IIT, Bombay(IITB) I made a typo on Google. I searched for 'IIITB M.Tech courses' and a typo that totally changed my life altogether :D. IIITB, a college I have never heard before.! I jumped onto the college website and was totally amazed seeing the faculty profiles, placement statistics and something that I really loved was they consider ECE GATE scores too. That too I could start fresh and get a M.Tech in IT straight as normal B.Tech CS graduates do. Huge relief!! I searched all over quora to see testimonies of students and I would have come across this very same question 3 years back! I even contacted several students who were doing their courses then, bugged them enough over Facebook/LinkedIn and I decided to give this college a try! Things that weren't impressive - small campus, budding college, ranked way below top NITs, not popular, huge fees!!! Ignoring all those I applied there for M.Tech in IT and kept it as my backup plan.! Unfortunately, I screwed up all my interviews in IITD, IITM, and IISc. I was in immense stress as I was in my notice period and company wasn't treating me well. I was running short on leaves and slipped into the loss of pay zone. I didn't attend interviews of IITB, IIT-KGP and IITK because these were mainly ECE courses and was out of my interest and also I was totally broke by then! Finally i was falling back to my backup plan. And at the very end I chose IIITB Mtech IT over IITG M.Tech VLSI. A decision I was criticised for a lot then! My time in IIITB : I kept my expectations minimal because I didn't want to get disappointed if the college didn't meet those and this time I was determined and focused to get the best out of me. But from day one the college kept amazing me!! There are several things I liked about this place: The college has a very diverse huge crowd.. We have people coming in from Kashmir down to Kerala (thats me! ). People who got fed up with their early corporate life and joining here as a last resort (thats me again!) . People coming in just after their B.Techs. People coming in with focus on research and a PhD later. All coming in with lots of hope and determination! For this same reasons, the crowd here is very much focused towards acads. Compared to the heavy competitive environment in my B.Tech, this place had down to earth people ready to help each other. Since I was learning CS concepts from scratch, I have knocked many doors for help and suggestions and none of them have ever turned their back at me.!   The seniors out there were really supportive and always ready to help you out. This is something you will see throughout the course. Alumni network is one of the strongest you would see in IIITB. I had literally bugged many of them over Facebook asking for their reviews on college before I joined. They stayed next to us from the very first day of our preparatory semesters to the very last day of our placements!!! Hats off Guys!! The faculties..! My prior experiences with faculties were terrible during my B.Tech. Most of them were scary experiences which gave me an impression that its always a bad idea to approach them! Ive seen faculties taking pride in giving most number 'F' grades in their courses, some making scary atmospheres in class, some engaging in frequent disagreements with the other faculties in not so cool ways, even there are ones who are constantly interested in torturing students rather than doing his profession.( There are good ones too!). Well IIITB faculties proved me wrong. It totally changed my perception of what a teacher/professor is.! The faculties here pretty cool and really put in lots of effort for the upbringing of the students and sets up best atmosphere for your growth. The faculties are one among the most approachable people I've seen here. Compared to my experience in NITC, the faculties here were able to put my brains to good use. Other good things to point out: Hostel rooms are pretty good, campus is neat and tidy, placement cell is super awesome, excellent coding culture, Bangalore is an amazing location for techies etc. There are some bad things too.. But I would probably consider to ignore these.. The college is in its budding stage, so its prone to make mistakes. Several occasions I did feel I had paid more for the facilities I received and also the administration looked student unfriendly several times. During my time I had trouble with the mess food! Its pure vegetarian mess and people like me who are used to daily non-veg diet had trouble coping up. There is no option to quit hostel mess too. No wonder why foodpanda made a huge profit out of me during my 2 years here! We had a sudden hike in our fees during the middle of the course which totally disturbed me for a while. During the final semester, you are forced to stay in the hostel if you are interning anywhere in Bangalore (a city where distance is measured in traffic units!!). I interned 25km away from my college..which would waste around 4-5 hours each day in Bangalore traffic. Another thing I hated big time was the insane curfew timings, even boys aren't allowed to go out of campus after 10 pm.! Happiest part is at the end of course completion almost everyone lands with a decent paycheck. Most of them would have got their internships converted. I believe the placement committee is capable enough to get every student a job given the students have the right attitude!. A remarkable achievement worth mentioning is that a team from Integrated Mtech batch has appeared for the ACM ICPC World Finals..!! And yes this college is going places..!! PS : There are couple of changes in early 2018. The ESD course is renamed and restructured. Also the Gate Paper criteria for IT admissions have changed. (**I am feeling lucky**). Please do go through the college website thoroughly as the info shared above might be outdated. Please check the comments section for more updates from students who have completed/pursuing their courses in IIITB.

For undergraduate admissions, IITH only accepts merit students based on JEE Advanced rank. For postgraduate, IIITH has a separate exam called PGEE while IITH accepts students based on GATE rank. Location: IITH is in disadvantage at this one as it is located very far from the city and it gets really tough to get to the campus and out of it but IIITH campus is located well within the city and all the IT companies are a stone throwaway. Research: It is true that IIITH is very good in AI research but IITH being a very new institute is also growing quite big in research with Nvidia setting an AI center in IITH. Coding Culture: It is very different to beat IIITH in coding as coding is a thing here. Students code all the time and then discuss with their friends about coding problems. Seniors encourage coding. Assignments are coding heavy too because of which a coding culture is engrained in the veins of every IIITan. Placements: I don't think we need to talk about placements as both the institutes have great placements with high average CTCs. So, I think both are similar in terms of placements. I don't have stats for IITH but placements for CSE is great there. Brand value: IITH clearly wins in this. As IITs have a lot of brand value for us Indians and we think they are the absolute best.

Fees: As we live in a 3rd world country, fees is a major concern for a lot of Indian students though you do can get loan for your education and both colleges are reputed so taking a loan would not be a problem but in most cases you have to pay first semester fees on your own. You can get loan from the banks at the campus once you arrive in your campus that's what happens in most cases. IIITL has a fees of around 155k for 1 semester while IIITB is more expensive with a fees of around 225k. So, in terms of fees IIITL has an advantage. 3.) Location: The location of your campus plays a role sometimes. IIITB being in the silicon valley of our country has many advantages over IIITL like many startups won't be traveling that far to Lucknow to hire candidates instead they will hire from IIITB as both colleges are good. Plus, you will get other advantages of living in a metro city like you will get more activities to do in the city of Bangalore then Lucknow. 4.) Faculty: Faculty plays a great role in shaping an engineer's career because if the curriculum is new and up to date with good amount of assignments and teacher is good in teaching then you will learn a lot. And I think IIITB wins in this department because I know IIITB has some good profs with good publishing records and experience of research and teaching while most profs at IIITL are young who do not have much experience in teaching and guiding students for research. 5.) Campus: I don't know whether IIITL has started operating from it's own campus or not. It was operating from IIIT Allahabad which is its mentor institute. And IIITA's campus is better than IIITL hands down. It has more facilities which will give you more exposure to extra curricular when compared to IIITB and IIITL's new campus also looks promising. 6.) Type of organizations: IIITL is a government institute while IIITB is an autonomous institute. So, if you want a stamp from your relatives that you studied in a government institute then go for IIITL else with IIITB :p 7.) Placements: I think IIITB wins in this hands down because average package in IIITL for the batch of 2020 is 18.42 lpa while it is 24.76 lpa for IIITB. 8.) Personal opinion: If I had a choice, I would have gone with IIITB because IIITB is older, more reputed and better in many regards compared to IIITL as of now who knows about the future. So, in my opinion IIITB is better than IIITL. ",0.2094621621621622,Positive,3.4189243243243244,0.018867924528301886,1,4.418924324324324,3.4189243243243244

You have to start research from mostly 3rd year of college in which you have to choose the lab you are interested working in. While IIITB offers integrated Mtech which is a 5 year program. So, if you want a fixed program in which you will get a degree by the end of 5th year then you should choose IIITB as IIITH does not offer a fixed duration dual program. If you feel comfortable with research and time is not a concern then IIITH is the best bet for you as the dual degree program not only will introduce you with new fields but will also give you a taste of research. And most importantly doing a dual degree program from IIITH does not mean that you cannot complete the program in 5 years. There are many students who have completed their degree in 5 years but it all depends on you and also the research area you choose.

All three institutes are doing great. But in spite of being a new college IIIT Lucknow has shown great results. Following are the points on which a candidate chooses a college - Branch - IIIT Lucknow currently offers Btech programs in IT and CS, but from this year a new branch CSAI (Btech in CS with specialization in artificial intelligence) has been announced. AI is the demand of the industries these days. IIIT Banglore only offers programs in CS and ECE. While IIIT Lucknow and IIIT Delhi offer 4 years Btech programs, IIIT Banglore only offers 5 years integrated program in which both Btech and Mtech degrees are provided to the eligible students at the end of 5 years. The Mtech degree is not useful in the integrated program. The extra one year goes waste. When it comes to placements (for which most of us go to a college) companies tend to prefer b.tech grads over dual grads Course curriculum - All the colleges have a great course curriculum which is focused mainly to fulfil modern industrial needs. Placements - This is the factor according to which almost all the students choose their college. The placements of IIIT Delhi and IIIT Banglore are great as they are old colleges but IIIT Lucknow in spite of being a new college are amazing. The placements stats of IIIT Lucknow are even better from some of the IITs. Placement stats of IIIT Lucknow are : First Batch (2015 - 2019) - 98% placed with 11.37 LPA avg. packageSecond Batch (2016 - 2020) - 100% placed with 18.42 LPA avg packageThis proves that in the coming years IIIT Lucknow will be one of the top colleges in India competing with old IITs and IIITs. Coding culture - The coding culture is great in all three colleges. In ACM-ICPC (the biggest coding contest) a team from of IIIT Lucknow took the 9th position in the regional round and qualified for the Asia finals beating almost all the IITs and IIITs. The web developers of IIIT Lucknow are also doing great. IIIT Lucknow has GSOCers as well as mentors in GSOC. Also, only IIIT Lucknow also has a Github Campus Expert which are only a few in the world.

First years do not have any separate hostel; the hostel is common for everyone. The slight differences are in room allotment; senior students are given preference for single rooms if they desire. But the actual alottment of a hostel room is based on distance of home to institute. 3. Boys hostels have twin sharing rooms, girls hostels have triple sharing rooms (don't ask me why, I don't know). The sharing rooms are slightly bigger (to accommodate an extra bed). The furnishings are the same; you get one bed, one study table, one almirah, and a few drawers, for each room occupant. 4. The common rooms has subscriptions to a lot of magazines and newspapers (daily, weekly as well as monthly). The common room has a 40 inch smart TV which has subscription to Netflix, Amazon Prime, Hotstar and Alt Balaji. . After IIT Delhi, IIITD is the best college in Delhi.

This year, JEE main would have unbelievable marks vs. rank statistics. This is because of (a) the uncertainty of percentile and batches system and (b) because the applicants have a lot more time to prepare for the exam. However, it must be said that many people can not travel to study centers and schools because of the lockdown period.Even if there were no coronavirus in 2020, I would not be sure given just marks. Maybe your percentile in January attempt would be of little more help, but even that would not suffice. Why? Simply because there are two attempts. Your percentile can increase or decrease drastically.Your tests were out of 300, not 360. So, that adds to the problem even more. However, marks are relative but also uncertain.My Verdict: I need more information. Honestly. I’m sorry to say this, but a simple “Can XXX marks get me into YYY college” is an unanswerable question. You could be thinking, But, you’re a student at the college, right? Surely you’ll have some idea about this… Yes, I do have a vague idea about what percentile you should have after the April attempt. Please note that this is solely my opinion, and may not reflect what goes down during admission. Cut-offs are decreasing from the past two years, and I believe it will decrease even further. Note- Decreasing cut-offs mean lower ranks; harder to get into. I think 99.3 to 99.4 %ile should be a safe zone for any applicant. If not CSE, he/she should easily get into ECE. My advice: Do not think about how many marks you should get to score X %ile or get Y rank. Believe me, it will hamper not only your preparation but also your exam. Approach an exam with an open mind.

If your main goal is to expand your knowledge and expertise on the subject, this is the way to go.Two major disadvantages are that it’s difficult to curate relevant, good content from the sea of online courses, and it’s difficult to structure your learning. Enrolling in a “full-fledged course” helps overcome with these.Finally, what makes correspondence and diploma courses (like Upgrad) stand out is the mentorship, lectures from industry experts from big companies, placement opportunities and the potential to connect with other people in the industry.Before you jump into anything that requires a significant investment of your time and money, please make sure that it contributes towards the specific goal you hope to achieve.If you wish to know more about my experience with Upgrad, take a look at my answer on a similar question here:Aakash Dusane's answer to Is it worth doing (PGDDA) by IIIT-Bangalore and UpGrad costing 2Lahks INR?

I will focus on the rest half the question, which compares colleges’ placements with cutoffs. Like seriously? There is a concept in maths/statistics:1. Correlation doesn’t imply causation.  Source: Correlation is not causation Let’s try to understand this photo. In summers (in hot countries like India), if one gets enough sun exposure, one may get a sunburn. In summer, people also try to eat ice cream for countering the heat. Hence, summer causes sunburn and also high sales of ice cream. Hence, if one would try to plot “ice cream sales” against sunburn cases for a year, one would clearly notice a correlation (both high in summer, and both low in winters). Does that mean ice cream causes sunburns? A big no. This is what is meant by “correlation doesn’t imply causation”. Similarly, when most of the IT companies come for campus placements (in any college) (including Google, Facebook, Microsoft etc top companies), they do not care about your JEE rank or PCM knowledge at all. Most of the IT companies do not care much about your college either. As long as you know a decent knowledge of computer science, have a strong profile/resume as measured by coding experience, internships and projects, and can clear their interviews, they would be happy to hire your irrespective of college. Most of the giant tech companies like Microsoft or Amazon hire from colleges all the way from IIT Bombay to tier 2 local colleges. 2. Ah, the good old student quality. That doesn’t matter at all. Your PCM knowledge has no real impact on your CS knowledge. It’s certainly possible to learn a lot of CS in a 4-year degree, despite having a bad rank in JEE and vice versa. IIIT B, H, D vs “top 10” NITs are a great example of this. There are 5 pointers and 9 pointers in all colleges. In any college, there are people who just do the bare minimum to pass courses, and then there are those who publish research papers, do GSoC, make great projects etc. With online courses available on Coursera etc, and great on-campus courses at IIIT B, it’s no longer a wonder why their students fare better than the “top 10” NITs students who might be learning from an outdated curriculum, having little practical projects and demotivated peer group. My friends from such “top 10” NITs have told me that their students simply mug stuff from GeeksForGeeks for exams and labs, and do well in them. Since their professors/MTech students also set questions from the same websites. 3. Peer group effect. During my college days at BITS Goa, I realized that the peer group is a way too important factor in any college. Your peers might not have a great JEE rank, but if they are motivated to learn CS and code, no one can stop them from achieving great things. And, it’s next to impossible to get motivated to learn stuff without your friends doing the same. I think (in general) NITs having 50% state quota messes up the peer group. It creates one of these two situations: One is where it divides people from the home state against the people from rest of India. (i.e. people from the home state befriend only each other, and not with people from other states.) (Cultural divide)Another is where people from the home state dominate the culture of the college and do not let people from other states contribute to the culture. (I.e. cultural domination, instead of cultural assimilation.) IIIT Bangalore does not have any state reservation. Hence, such cultural problems would not arise there. At BITS Goa, too, I saw a very open, and pan-Indian culture, not quite Goa specific. As someone has rightly said, “By the end of the college, you will be the average of the five people that you spend most of your time with.” 4. Why low cutoffs? Another reason for low cutoff is addressed in another answer by Sri Harsha G. The cutoff isn’t decided by college, but by the students (JEE aspirants), who mostly have no clue which college/program is good and which is not, and usually just follow last year’s trends. Hence, the cutoff being low for such a great college (IIIT B) just means that people do not know much about it.

I was in a similar dilemma when I was deciding my college last year! I came to know about IIIT B after my first JEE main exam only! (Through Aman Dhattarwal bhaiya’s video) All the stats were very good for this college and even the placements! The research side is even increasing at an exponential rate in the college! But, here, we run into a doubt - Why is the cutoff of IIIT B so low (8500 rank) compared to other colleges? After a lot of research, I found answers to such questions and convinced myself to spend my next five years in this college. The main reasons are: It is a public-private co-owned Institute. (I.e. Although it is a private institute, it is also partially funded by Karnataka government.)Hence, the fees at IIIT B would be higher than other colleges(NITs) which we get admission into, at this JEE main rank. Hence, most people will prefer NITs in this aspect!It does not follow any kind of reservation policy. Hence, all the students of IIIT B are allotted seats based on merit. Hence, it is obvious for the cutoff to go for lower ranks (around 8k, which is even a very good rank) to fill up its seats. (Since the number of general category seats would be double compared to other colleges.)According to me, we should never check ranks when there is no reservation. Because even if the second last student’s rank is 5k, the cutoff rank only depends upon the last student who joins. (Hence, the cutoff may go to quite a low rank.)Private IIITs (Hyd, Bangalore and Delhi) are becoming famous only in the last few years. (Even then, IIIT H is already at par with top 7 IITs.)The main reason IIIT B has not yet become famous is that although it was established in 1999, it offered only a few programs, but did not offer any BTech program. All the courses were research-oriented higher degrees - masters and PhD etc.The UG program was started only around 2011. And even then, it was an iMTech (5-years) program only. (There is no BTech program offered even now!)Hence, until now, only 4 batches have graduated. (Even then, the median salary is very good!) And moreover, people do not prefer to take up a 5-year course, because many people would have a plan to pursue MS abroad instead of an MTech. Hence, despite having these many problems, I think IIIT B has a very reasonable cutoff rank.

They will guide you through the whole admission process at IIIT-B from the submission of an application to the generation of the credentials to the portal. The whole process is hassle-free. They will start off by giving some brush-up lectures before the start of the program so that once the program begins you will be able to grab the concepts easily. The course is defined in a well-defined structure with careful thought put into the structure of the program and advances gradually from basic programming concepts to specialization concepts. The program is structured keeping in mind freshers and experienced people alike. The student-mentor plays an important part in your course. They will help you at every part and will be available on Whatsapp, call or email to address any or all doubt that you have. The content part is good with many hands-on examples and assignments which will engage your thought process to think like working in a real blockchain organization. The instructors are all well established SME’s in their respective domains and are very well versed. You will also get a live session where you can join these sessions and get all your doubts cleared and discuss the difficulty that you are facing. You will be interacting with Industry experts so that’s a good exposure where you will learn all the work that is going around in this technology. All in all, if you think you want to learn Blockchain, UpGrad is the place to learn from. All the best to all the guys and gals out there!! May you make the right decision. Edit 1: I have been seeing a lot of guys have faced issues regarding the strict timeframe of the course and if you are currently working then how would you manage the time between work and the course, but let me assure you guys, it just a matter of getting the schedule aligned. Once you have aligned your work and the study, it becomes a disciplined schedule and you would not face the issue, which in my case is what I saw. The course itself is a Post Graduate Diploma and it takes some time and effort to get used to all the 10–12 hours per week study but trust me, it will pay off. Also, the best part which I got from this course was Alumni status from IIIT-B by studying from home without leaving my job.

But so far whatever covered is great. As it is actually a diploma in Software Development so the course starts with basic knowledge of programming, data structure and algorithms which might be redundant for the one having computer engineering background. I will later update on this after few months when I’ll get exposed to real blockchain related content. Update ( 4 January 2020) - Sorry for not giving any update till now (there’s a reason). Short answer: I left the course midway. Long answer: Along with most guys in my cohort, I also left the course, wasting my 75k around… So why I left the course?; I am working as a software engineer and I expected to complete this course along with my Job, upgrad guys will also assure you that it is manageable. But believe me, it is not. If you can’t afford a break in your career then don’t go for this stunt. We just simply can’t take out 10–15 hours from week for study. One week with any other emergency and you are off track. Once you loose pace then you loose all motivation to be in the race. Yes, it’s very time intensive program. What makes it so time intensive?; I am from IT background, so course 1 was just a revision for me, I know everything of it and was not necessary, still I had to go through each lesson, each video in lesson(which we can’t skip or jump), each mcq. Overall there is no way we can skim through the content if we want to. Is content good?; I would say they have nice content; but for a 1.5 lac course, it is mediocre. It is just as good as any NPTEL couse would offer, in fact, NPTEL courses are better than this for some professors/modules. Also the course syllabus is too protracted and unnecessary to say the least. Lastly and most important, you enroll this course basically to learn blockchain, and what you find when you check the course is, only 3 out of 9 courses are related to blockchain, rest are software engineering related. This is the biggest con of this but it is justifiable as the program name itself says ‘Diploma in Software Engineering’ and specialization in blockchain. Regarding the jobs, market hasn’t created any jobs for blockchain as of now(Jan’20), so don’t hope for career switch directly in blockchain. You might get good software engineer role based job with this certification. Honestly I guess if you could find any blockchain course within Rs.30000/-, then you can go for that course. And to learn software engineering(algorithms, programming) and web application development, there are outstanding free courses available on internet. I’m posting some links below: Introduction to Programming 2. Object Oriented Programming using Java  3. Data Structures  4. Algorithms   (Note: Above playlist from hackerrank is the exemplar of how a course should be, perfect pace, crisp and to the point, and excellent delivery.) 5. Application Development, SVN, and hosting Introduction to Modern Application Development 4. Blockchain  5. Hyperledger  All videos which directs to youtube are actually part of playlists. I don’t know how to share playlist link here so please search for them in youtube. That’s all guys, I would like to conclude saying, choose wisely and whatever you choose to do, be prepared to bear it’s consequence.

The cut-offs for IIIT-B iMtech are decided, as you know, by filtering the applications the college receives. Due to rising competition and increasing awareness about IIIT-B and its merits, cut-offs are decreasing. In 2018, the cut-off was 11,790 In 2019, the cut-off was 10,792 Notice something? The cut-offs decreased by a staggering 1,000 ranks. So, I expect that the cut-offs for 2020 will follow a similar trend, and the expected cut-off for iMtech ECE is 9,800–9,900 Points to be noted:- The cut-offs given in the website is for the last round of counselling(3rd round).You can not apply under your category rank, as there is no Reservation, ONLY MERIT.

Now before I begin answering this question, I want you to know that I would be answering in very detail by laying out my whole journey and experience. So if you are running low on time and looking for the short answer, yes or no types, then here is the gist of my final answer: “Unless and until you have any other bigger options like masters, you should not think twice for enrolling into this program. I have explored each and every viable options like MOOC courses or training centers, as you might have also done, but trust me, you cannot get a better deal than this. All in all, it’s a complete package. So go ahead for it. Even I had to gather enough courage to take the first step, but have never regretted it. And I am sure you will never regret this decision too!” For those who are still with me, I know you still have a lot of doubts which cannot be answered by just knowing the final conclusion, stated above. And I completely understand that, because some time back, I had my mind filled with the same doubts and was also skeptical about this program. At that time, I too was literally searching for someone who might have already enrolled into the program and wanted them to answer my particular doubts in detail, not just a good or bad review. Also, you will find many such reviews easily on the internet, so instead of doing an old wine in a new bottle thing, I thought to answer this question in a bit different way. Assuming that most of you will be having the same doubts as I had at that time, I will be forming the questions out of that doubts, and will answer that doubts pinpoint with every possible detail based on my experience. So let’s get into it: “ Q1) What convinced me to spend such a huge amount (approx. 2 lakhs) for this online program, when we have other cheaper options through MOOC’s (Massive Open Online Education) platforms like edx, Udacity, Coursera, Udemy, etc? Ans) Well, I have a long history of learning through MOOC’s. I have taken at least a course or two from all of the reputed MOOC’s listed above. And as you guys might be knowing, the one thing that this course offers what others not is, a post graduate diploma degree. A diploma degree is always heavily weighted in comparison to a certification. This difference largely convinced me to enroll into this program instead of opting for any certified courses. Secondly, the course is offered by a renowned university i.e. International Institute of Information Technology - Bangalore (IIIT-B). Hence I was sure that a certificate from any other platform, be it edX, Coursera or Udacity, won’t leave the same impact as the diploma degree from an institute like IIIT-B will leave, on my resume. Now, coming to the cost of the program, I have heard a lot of people arguing that we can learn the same content for a lesser cost through other MOOC’s. That’s somewhat true, but that argument is not really valid here. If we see it that way, then what is the point of even spending money for our bachelors, because nowadays, we can even learn the whole bachelor curriculum online, through MOOC’s. So why are we spending lakhs of rupees to get a bachelor’s degree? We are still spending for two reasons: a. This is probably the most important reason. To get a UGC approved degree which will serve as a recognition of our educational achievement, and it can open many doors instantly that a certificate or self-learning thing can’t. And in this case, you are getting a diploma degree from a big institute like IIIT-B. That’s exactly like a cherry on the cake. b. To get a well-designed curriculum which covers all areas of the field, with regular exams and assignments to help us stay committed to the program. Also, many people forget that while learning through MOOC’s, there are not many options where we can get a course which covers the whole ground. Instead, you have to spend a lot of time and energy for finding multiple courses which go sequentially and cover the entire syllabus. Usually, you will end up finding many courses for hot topics, but you won’t find enough courses for niche topics. And then you will have a lot of unfilled gaps, which you won’t be even aware of. For the above two reasons, a rounded curriculum offered by degree or diploma is always valued more. Hence, there is no point arguing that we will be getting the exact content at lesser cost through online courses. Because believe me, we won’t. And, as people say, “Half Knowledge is always dangerous”. So be prepared for the adversity if you take the other way. According to me, it is more advisable to first develop a decent well-rounded skill set in this domain with a rigorous program that IIIT-B is offering, and then you can take the advantage of MOOC platforms to master a specific skill set that interests you the most. Simple. Q2) How is this program different from the online certificate courses offered by other big platforms in terms of quality and content? Is the quality and content of this program comparable to the quality of courses posted by Ivy-league institutes on MOOC platforms? Ans) Before enrolling into this program, I had taken a short course of data science from Udemy, a nanodegree course of deep learning from Udacity, and also a course of Machine Learning from Coursera developed by Stanford University. So I can easily draw the comparisons, since I have experience with both forms of learning. I think, the following three things are important for any program. Hence I would compare Upgrad with other platforms based on the following three parameters: a. Delivery of Content When I was learning with Udacity and Coursera, which are leading platforms for MOOC, I was truly impressed with their content delivery, because they explained the concepts with visual animations and figures instead of an instructor just reading the presentation. And visual memory always lasts longer. Since this is a new foreign trend, I was not really expecting the same form of learning from this program at such an early stage. And that’s why I was surprised even more when I found of that IIIT-B and Upgrad have marked their level by delivering the content with the same modern trend. So in terms of content creation and delivery, this medium stands the same with other giant platforms and universities. Plus, occasionally, you will have sessions by industry experts where they will provide you with a practical usefulness of a concept in the industry. And also, live sessions taken by subject experts to answer your doubts, to provide you a complete classroom experience. That’s much more than what you are offered in other certificate courses. b. Exams, Assignments and Projects. Assignments, Exams and Projects are the most important thing to look for when we enrol into any program. That’s because, assignments and projects help us to build the portfolio to show off to the recruiters. And exams help us stay committed to the program, as well as ensure that we are digesting the important stuff. This program provides you ample assignments, which can be easily linked to the real world. Also, you will have a group case study which helps you to engage yourself with other members of the program and gives you the opportunity to do a team work. Furthermore, they will provide you with a detailed feedback about your submitted work, and this is where the real learning happens – Learning from our own mistakes. Hence, take this assignment thing really seriously and be sure to spend out enough time every weekend. Because the assignments are time consuming, but at the same time, they are truly satisfying. And you will not be doing this just once or twice. Instead, you will be doing this at least twice a month, for 11 months! So by the end of the program, you will be having a whole armor of projects in many domains like BFSI, E commerce, Car-Rentals, Healthcare etc., to show off to your recruiter. And the deadlines for these assignments help us to maintain the pace with the class by forcing us to sacrifice our weekends working for it. So look at the deadlines positively. Also, you will be having graded questions at the end of every module, and web proctored exams quarterly, where they will be testing your actual learning from the course. At the end of the program, they will replicate the industry experience for you by providing you with an opportunity to undergo a 2-3 months long industry capstone project. I know it’s a little bit intimidating as they bombard us with a lot many things all at once, but you have to remember that nothing worth having ever comes easy. And as they are promising, this meticulously designed curriculum will surely prepare you for the future, if you follow them sincerely and honestly without giving up. No matter what, just hold on with them, and you will be good! c. Mentorship Support This is where Upgrad steps in. What I can see so far is, IIIT-B collaborated with Upgrad for two main reasons: 1) To help them take the whole content online on the platform, and maintain the same platform unimpaired. 2) To act as a mediator between students and professors. And Upgrad has truly proved its worth by providing a service which completely satisfies both the above reasons. They have created an engaging platform, which is flawless and user friendly, well designed with all the features you expect, really easy and nice to navigate, in a nutshell -- Very Impressive!! But their bigger and more challenging task was to act as mediator. And I cannot appreciate their efforts enough for achieving this task. They have really set a high bar with this one. Firstly, not many platforms or programs (to which you usually compare this program with), provide a mentorship support. Of all the courses I have taken till date, I only received a mentorship support from Udacity and little bit from Coursera. But no other platform has provided enough justification to this mentorship word, as Upgrad did! They have created a discussion platform where the mentors answer our questions or verify the answers provided by the peers. Not only this, soon after you enroll into the program, you will be provided with a dedicated student mentor who will help you with all the technical difficulties you may encounter, will help you stay motivated during the course if you are falling behind the pace or if you self-doubt your capabilities, will take your request up to the team and the mentors if you are stuck somewhere, will keep you informed about the deadlines by repeatedly reminding you through all the possible mediums of communication like mails, messages as well as calling you personally if required. And above all, they are never hard to reach when you really are in trouble. Personally, I have never been left unattended by them for more than a few hours on any day, be it a weekday, weekend or official holiday! They surely do get back to you as soon as they see your queries. To sum things up, they are always prepared to take an extra step to make this seemingly hard journey plain sailing for us. This is definitely not the case with any other MOOC platforms that most people are talking about. You can never have a personal telephonic conversation with mentors in other platforms as this program provides an opportunity to connect. So the mentorship program provided by other platforms is not even comparable to the one provided by Upgrad. Forget about comparison, they are not even in the same bracket. And this is the thing that separates Upgrad and this program from other possible options by a large factor. I can strongly vouch for them any day, anytime, on this parameter. Q3) Where will I land up or can expect to land up after graduating from the program? Ans) This is the most common and frequently asked question, since at the end, our target is to provide a justification to the time, energy and money spent. So there is no doubt that this question will be continuously banging in your head before making a 11-month long commitment. But at the same time, I want you to know that this is a very generic question. Because the people enrolling in this program are very much diverse in terms of age and work experience. To give you quick idea about the range, you will find students who just completed their bachelors and have no work experience (like me), as well as you will find working professional having 10+ years of work experience in the related or unrelated domain. Hence the answer to this generic question has to be generic as well. For that reason, I will be dividing the enrollments in 3 possible categories: a. Student who just graduated with a primary degree. I was in the same category, so I will be able to answer this part in the best way. Usually, these students enroll into the program for two reasons. First being, they want to get a specialized degree to get into a specialized domain like data science, and their ultimate target is to get a job in the same domain after graduating. For them, I would say that though data science is a booming industry which has a lot of openings these days, you have to remember that this field has a ruthless competition as well, and you have to possess truly advance skills to place a leg in this domain. Also, you are at slight disadvantage that you do not have a work ex, which is usually a primary requirement for core data science jobs. But at the same time you have an easy way to make career in the domain right from the beginning, because shifting a career at a later stage appears intimidating than making the career in the intended domain from the beginning itself. What you can do is, instead of straight away opting for core data science positions, which demands a lot of other skills than just a PG diploma degree, you can target a slightly more achievable options like data administrator or Business Analyst jobs. By gaining enough experience in this position, you can eventually target the bigger positions like data engineer, data architect and data scientists. And this program, for sure, will help you develop enough skills to at least get you a job in these elementary positions. Also, as I was talking about two reasons students enroll into the program, the second reason is; they want to eventually pursue masters in the same domain. And mean while they want to get a diploma degree with their current job to build a profile and get a head start during masters. This crowd is at the maximum advantage in terms of their final goal, because the profile that you will develop at the end of this program will almost get you an entry at most of the prominent universities you might be dreaming about. I personally got into a university (USC) which has its ranking in the top 50 unis of the world, for masters in data science, solely based on the profile I developed with this program. So you cannot go wrong with any scenario stated above! b. Working Professionals already working in a related domain and looking to upgrade their knowledge to get into bigger positions related to data science. I do not have a personal experience with this, because as I said, I belong to the first category above. But I was in touch with some of my peers, and have seen them getting promoted to bigger position within just months after enrolling into the program. Also, the maximum transitions that I have seen from the graduates of this program is from Software Engineer to Business Analyst, Data Analyst and Data Engineer. So if you are a working professional and coincidentally a software engineer looking to get into a data science domain, trust me you guys have the best bet to make here. You have somewhat related work experience, and you are already very near to the target domain. And this program will act as a catalyst to help you get to your final goal in probably just months. Just check out the student testimonials on upgrad platform, if you are still not willing to take my word for this! c. Working professionals in unrelated domain, looking to get into the data science domain. Again, I cannot relate with you completely over here. Because as you read above, I was a fresher when I enrolled. But, I can somewhat relate to you because I had my bachelors in completely unrelated domain i.e. Mechanical. And hence, I think I can answer the question by explaining you how this program helped me switch my domain successfully. Firstly, I want you to understand that data science is not really strict about domain. Because it is more about mathematics and less about programming. So if you are from any engineering background, you have the required mathematics skills to take up this domain and all you lack is just enough programming power. I was a novice programmer when I enrolled into the program, and the program is designed keeping people like us in mind. They also have pre-requisite sessions to help us take the necessary programming skills. Now, coming to the “life after graduation” part, the same concept that I advised above to the fresher’s applies to people like us. No matter how much unrelated work exp you have, you are almost a fresher in this domain. So do not expect core data science jobs right from the beginning, else you will be disappointed. You already have a work ex and industry knowledge, though unrelated. So it will be a cake walk for you to get jobs like business analyst and junior data analysts since this positions require general industry knowledge and corporate work experience (which you already have) and basic data science knowledge that you will probably develop in just few months after enrolling into the program. These jobs usually do not require advanced mathematics or programming skills. Once you gain enough experience in this domain, you can eventually switch to advanced data science positions like data engineer, data architect or data scientist. And your transition to bigger positions will be much quicker as you already had a work experience, which is kind of a pre-requisite for core data science positions. So do not think that changing the domain at a later stage in life is useless, because the skills you developed in other domains will be easily relatable to the new data science job. That’s the beauty of this field. And that skills and experience is indirectly going to help you climb the ladder much faster than others. You are at no loss; you are just at different path. Please keep this in mind! Q4) How will this program and Upgrad Services will help me to get a job? Do they guarantee a job? If they do not guarantee, what is there actual role? What if I do not land at any job after graduating from the program? Ans) Guarantee!? I have seen a lot of people, who are obsessed with this word and want absolute surety before making the big decisions. That’s not wrong, but that’s not always right either. And that’s definitely not right at least at this place. Let me counter question you to make things more clear. When you enrolled into your bachelors, did they guarantee you to get a job at the end of four years? I am sure, they did not. But you still engaged yourself for 4 years just in the hope of getting one at the end after graduating. Even IIT’s do not guarantee a job to anyone, that what can we expect from other universities. And they are right at their part. Why would any college or university guarantee? They are here to provide education not a job. Job is just the outcome of the education, which obviously is the ultimate goal of most of us. But they are not bound to provide that. So instead, your question should be “Will they help me develop enough skills to get a job in this booming industry after graduating?” Now we are talking, because that’s the right question. And the answer to this is, definitely, they will. Though the ultimate learning is up to you, and how genuine you are with your commitment, but they surely provide you enough skills with their comprehensive curriculum explained above, to make you a potential candidate for data science and related jobs. Not only this, they also help you assimilate all your leanings at the end and provides enough services to help you reach your end goal. These services include, 1) Career Placement modules to provide you a sneak peek of the industry demands right at the beginning, so that you know what you need to get there at an early stage and have ample time to prepare for that. 2) Once you know what you need to get there, your immediate question will be, how to get there? And you will have a lot many doubts related to that. That’s why, they will occasionally arrange mentorship calls for you, where the experts, currently working at the positions where you dream to land, will have a personal telephonic conversation with you. And you are free to ask them any questions related to the domain and job. That’s enough pampering, you cannot and should not expect more. 3) Now, since your vision is clear on where you want to go and how to get there, it’s your responsibility to develop the required skills by engaging in the maximum possible way into this program, and making the most out of it. Their role here is to provide you all the content and teach you the required concepts, by keeping a check on your pace through deadlines. But you need to do the real work here. 4) After you have developed the skills by following the program thoroughly, Upgrad again gets into action to help you accumulate all your learnings and will connect you again to the industry experts who will help you prepare a resume and provide you tips on showing off most of the skills and projects that you developed in this journey. Showing off what we know is one of the most important part in getting a job. Because as you might be knowing, a recruiter develops the first impression about us by just looking at our resume, for a min or two. So you cannot take this thing for granted. Upgrad and industry experts will give their best to help you pour your eleven months of effort into a single page resume, which will then decide your future. Try to take the most advantage of this process! 5) To be honest, I did not really experience anything beyond this part, since my goal was to get into a reputed university for masters. And if you read above, I already managed to get into a fairly decent university by then. So I cannot accurately comment on the services Upgrad has to offer after this point, since I did not opt for it. But as far as I know, they are right now arranging Mock Interview Sessions and they also have tie-ups with many industry partners, where they recommend their students. Also, I frequently receive mails from Upgrad regarding job openings where they ask me to mail them my resume, but as I said, I am not availing these services for the above reasons. However, looking at their consistency, I am sure they will be providing a satisfactory support to other students who are aiming for the jobs. Also, apart from Upgrad Career Services, I would advise you to keep looking for jobs yourself by sending the resumes and contacting recruiters yourself through linkedin or any other medium. Some of my peers successfully transitioned their jobs or got a new job this way. And, if you manage to get an interview call yourself, then you can surely ask Upgrad to arrange a mock interview session for you. Upgrad did arrange for my peers that I am talking about. And they reviewed the mock interview sessions as truly helpful. ” I know it was a pretty long answer. But I just remembered the problems that I faced while enrolling, and thought to solve them for others by answering this question in such a way as I was expecting someone to answer when I had to make this call. I have tried to cover the major doubts that I had during my time, but there is a possibility that you might be having some other doubts that I missed or that didn’t occur to me.

They may go on leaves however there would be a backup person whom you can touchbase with.If you are a brand freak, then you need to understand that IIIT-B is still in process of getting it UGC Approved since its entirely an online course.Co-students can help you whilst they have done their part of the work and in their free-time and not always we keep bugging them and they can answer all questions at the very next moment of us raising the doubts/queries.Time is limited. You strictly need to dedicate time and if you are a professional, you need to consider spending atleast 2–3 hours per day to keep pace with the course. Else its sheer waste of time and moneyLive sessions which are scheduled may get cancelled at the last minute (due to some technical glitches) however they may be rescheduled for a later date.

Now, coming back to your question- NIT Warangal will be having a better syllabus and will cover in depth of all concepts as the teachers will be awesome there but there you will lack faculty members with industry expertise. Also, they will not provide placement assistance. However, the syllabus in IIIT will not be as vast as NIT but the teachers in IIIT will teach you everything that is required in working in the industry and you’ll get placement assistance as well. But in any case scenario, you’ll have to work hard to learn the required skill-sets and you’ll have to learn the hard way. So, if you’re looking for a research based career, go for NIT and if you want to learn and earn then go for IIIT. Hope this helps! Do let me know about your decision and progress. Keep Learning!!

Reason: There are no undergraduate or BTech programs at IIIT Bangalore. Even iMTech and MTech are offered primarily for CSE and ECE branches, only. Now coming to your question, average packages - IIIT Bangalore - 17.55 lpa for the year 2018-19 (figure is exclusive of 3 international offers). Just to highlight, the highest offer given at IIIT B of 54 lpa was from Rubrik, was very well a domestic offer. Top 7 IITs - Difficult to get accurate data (for CSE and ECE branches only). However, according to my understanding, it should be around 18 lpa (excluding international offers). IITs have significantly higher number of international offers. #Sometimes colleges calculate mean packages by including both domestic and international offers. Keep in mind to segregate domestic and international offers when comparing packages across colleges. International offers can significantly shoot up the averages. Edit: I have updated the answer to clear any doubts on domestic/international offers at IIIT B. Thanks Karthick and Tanmay for clarifying this.

This ensures that all students are at par and this really adds to the competitive spirit of IIITB. Electronic City, Bangalore is a better location than Warangal.

So here goes: A = 0, B = 01. Education Quality (Curriculum): The course structure of both the programmes are quite similar with nearly the same subjects in each semester. In both the cases, students get hands on with core computer science subject right from the beginning of the course, unlike other colleges where the first year is common across all the branches. Both the courses are quite relevant with respect to current industry standards and have a research edge as well. A = 1, B = 1 2. Infrastructure: The Allahabad campus is massive (so I have heard), compared to that Bangalore is miniscule(less than 10 acres). That being said, Bangalore does have all the requisites, proper lab facilities and sports facilities though they can be improved. UPDATE: IIIT-B now has a second Academic building which although increases the academic infrastructure, the campus itself remains of the same size and very small. A = 2, B = 1 3. Packages: The i M Tech Programme at IIIT-B started in 2012 and the first batch is just about to enter their 4th year. So, the kind of placements and packages they get still has some time to be known. The BTech Programme at IIIT-A on the other hand has been there for quite a long time (>15 years) and the placements and packages students get are just shy of what they give out at IIIT Hyderabad and the IITs.The M Techs at IIIT-B however get quite well placed, in companies including IBM, Microsoft, Google, Intel, Amazon, and others. UPDATE: The first batch of the i MTech Programme at IIIT-B is sat for placements over the 2016–2017 session and the kinds of placements and packages that they got is on equal footing with its MTech Programme as well as comparable to old IITs and IIIT-H. A = 3, B = 2 4. Faculty: This is where Bangalore really shines. With almost all the professors being Ph.Ds, professors at IIIT-B are Nationally and in several cases, Internationally known experts in their fields. Nearly every professor here is an industry veteran with both research and actual work experience under their belt. Allahabad has excellent professors but this is where Bangalore does own Allahabad. A = 3, B = 3 5. Peers: IIIT-Bangalore recognizes no reservations of any kind. Also from 2015, admissions to the iMTech programme are based solely on JEE score. This ensures there is no dilution in the quality of the students who join the institute. Also the interaction that takes place between iMTech students and the MTech students is much more than what happens in most colleges, including IIIT-A. Thus, the peer groups, seniors and juniors you'd interact would be of superior quality. A = 3, B = 4 6. Industry Connections and Internships: Being situated in the heart of India's Silicon Valley, Electronic City, Bangalore, IIIT-B enjoys an connection to the software and electronics industry, IIIT-A can hardly claim to match. Several professors have ties with people in key positions in industry and academia. This makes it easier for students to land internships even in their first/second year be it with startups or bigwigs like IBM. A = 3, B = 5 7. Coding/Learning Culture: The Coding culture at IIIT-Allahabad is excellent, one of India's best, all thanks to its wonderful students who understood the need for a proper competitive coding culture (All Hail Humblefool). Bangalore still needs to work on this, although there are quite a few gems in coding at the institute (Hail VastoLorde95). However being in the close vicinity of the Tech industry, IIIT-B students enjoy the opportunity to take part in the plethora of hackathons that take place in the city on a regular basis. Hackathons are a way of not just learning but showing off your application skills to those who can help you do something useful with those skills. For IIIT-A students, this is a drawback. UPDATE: A team from IIIT-B competed at the ACM-ICPC (led by our VastoLorde95) and competitive coding is fast picking pace in the institute. Also in the Google Summer of Code 2017, number of student selections from IIIT-B’s iMTech Programme stands at 9 (among 360 undergrads) compared to 12 (among 1050 undergrads) of IIIT-A. IIIT-B’s coding culture is fast catching up to IIIT-A’s. A = 4, B = 6 8. Campus Life: IIIT-A has a better campus life to offer to its students in terms of fests and clubs. This kind of a culture is still to catch up in IIIT-B. We have only a sports fest, Spandan held in March every year. UPDATE: We now also have an Annual Cultural fest - Infin8 held in January every year. A = 5, B = 6 9. Startup Culture: IIIT-B with its own proven Startup Incubator has better affinity for a startups. See 50 Amazing Startup Incubators and Accelerators in India which has clearly mentioned IIITB Innovation Center. IIIT-A is yet to start a Startup Incubation programme. Having a homegrown incubators allows infusion of ideas and helps students build their ideas into full fledged businesses. A = 5, B = 7 Well that's my way of looking at it. The choice is yours.

According to me these have been its distinguishing qualities: Research mindset: In the first year itself, most of our assignments and projects required us dig into topics not strictly in syllabus, on our own, and read about topics from various different sources. Many of our seniors pursue research internships in universities in India and abroad and a sizeable number go on to do PhDs.Junior senior interactions: I cannot stress this enough. We have very helpful and inspiring seniors who go out of their way to help us in anything ranging from - introducing us to different domains of technology, to guiding us in setting up clubs and organizing events, and even giving tips about any hobby we want to pursue!Lots of opportunities: since the population of the college is small, you get more opportunities to pursue what you want to do; as competition is comparatively lesser. You can take initiative and start clubs which you are interested in easily.Independence: the girls hostel has no specified in time unlike other institutes. The dress code is also pretty chill, so are any rules regarding campus/hostel life.Bangalore : since the campus is situated in the heart of electronic city of the IT hub of India, the opportunities are countless. Some hackathon or seminar keeps happening giving the students great exposure and opportunities.Though the campus is small, you get to know everyone in your batch, and a whole lot of amazing ppl in the college.

I had the exact same options and I understand how nerve-racking it may be to choose between these three amazing colleges, so let me try to simplify a little bit. It all depends on you. If you are a resident of Bangalore, and don’t want to go to hostel, RV is the one for you. It is a well-reputed college and the fact that you got CSE (hotly contested,ay?) means that you are in safe hands; the professors are great(At least that’s what I heard) and so is the college; you will enjoy the indoor basketball court if that’s your thing, while being surrounded by (mostly) like-minded individuals who aced KCET. But, bear in mind a few things. RV may not be how that one uncle on the street told you it will be. Don’t get me wrong, I have nothing against RV; it was indeed my dream college for many years. I’m talking about Management Quota. No matter what the college may proclaim, Management seats are sold like hot cakes(because it’s RV(read: aaarvee). This very popularity and cult following leads to its downfall. If you are ready for hostel, all three look promising,right? Let’s explore: If you want to do Computer Science and Computer Science ONLY, then don’t think that RV is your only option. IIIT-B’s first TWO YEARS has predominantly common syllabus for both; CSE and ECE(in iMtech). We sit together and learn programming and computer architecture. You also can do branch change by getting on the Dean’s Merit List. No reserved seats here for branch change. Your performance alone speaks volumes here. NIT-K EEE is also no doubt a great choice, but if you don’t want to do anything apart from CSE/IT, branch change is a big risk. You see, branch change follows a few rules, like- Your current branch strength must not decrease by more than 10%Your future branch strength must not increase by more than 10%Category-wise allotment of seats takes place, similar to JoSAA.Also, number of free seats are very low, and reservation makes it lower still. Look, I am not condemning reservation(in fact, it is good, but it is sadly misused-hence the conflicts) or anything, I’m just saying it’s much much harder to do Branch Change in NIT-K. If you are interested in Higher Studies: IIIT-B is the clear winner here. We have a superb iMtech program here, where you get two degrees(B.Tech and M.Tech) in the space of 5 years, instead of 6(4-B.Tech+2-M.Tech). In other colleges, you would have triple tension: Studying to maintain a good CGPAStudying PlacementsStudying for GATE(another JEE in itself(we don’t need reminding how competitive JEE is))Also, after you complete your four years, you face a very difficult trade-off: Job or higher studies? IIIT-B kills two birds with one stone; you get two degrees AND no need to apply for GATE. What I would suggest is not to think about “wasting an extra year studying instead of working” but how you can learn more in less time. The former opinion is held by a surprising number of people, who don’t seem to realise that a college is more than just placements. Which brings us to our next topic: Placements. I’ll let the numbers do the talking. Placement Statistics-IIITB R V College of Engineering-RVCE The EEE placements are notoriously hard to find, but I can tell some approximate numbers that I found after comparing statistics from other Core Branches(e.g Chemical) and answers on Quora, Shiksha etc. Placement % =~95 Average salary package = ~9,00,000 INR Here also, IIITB has the upper hand. It’s location plays a major role. Bangalore is a major IT hub and electronics city is the prime location. With Infosys (literally) a stone’s throw away and numerous other companies very close by, IIIT-B has become a big shot in industry. Also helping it is the fact that there is no reservation/management quota, so everyone is on the same learning curve. What I think is the most important parameter here, is next: Learning Outcomes. The curriculum and electives at IIIT-B is undoubtedly the best. Not many colleges recognise the interdependence of ECE and CSE , like IIIT-B does. As an ECE student, you become not the jack of all trades, but the master of all trades. You learn both concepts; CSE and ECE. And the quality of faculty needs no explaining. Have a look at it yourself: Faculty(IIITB) The labs are well-equipped and the library is excellent. You are taken care of, academically. While NITK has professors like IR Rao, you just can’t argue with the overall quality of faculty at IIIT-B. Hostels: You will stay here for the next 4(or 5) years. Having seen NIT-K and RVCE hostels and having lived in IIIT-B hostels, IIIT-B hostels are far better than the other two. Age is the reason for this, although all the facilities exist in all three colleges, they are better maintained in IIIT-B. Age has taken its toll on the other two. Also, the prime location of IIIT-B means that everything is just a stone’s throw away(not just Infosys). Verdict: It’s pretty clear. According to me, IIIT-B is the better option for you. It wins on almost all parameters listed above. But then again, you are joining a college, not me. So, here’s what I suggest you to do. Make an excel sheet and list out all the colleges you can joinDo your research. Intensive research. Know every detail about each college.List out all the parameters you feel are important. Not just campus size or highest placement package. Step out of that narrow mindset. Campus is not everything(Although all colleges have great campuses) and you will get highest salary package if and only if you work hard, not just because your college has a high number in that regard.People on the street must not have a high importance (although all three colleges are good, peoples’ eyes will pop out when you say you got RV). You do your research and you decide.You should have at least 15–20 parameters. Then, score them in an unbiased manner out of 10(say.)Choose the college with a higher number, and feel convinced with your choice. After all, you are studying, not anyone else.That’s how I joined here, in the amazing IIIT-B. If you do join here, be assured that there is no ragging, seniors are very helpful and kind. You will love it. If you have any doubts, DM me. I will try to help out :) Vijay, came to IIIT-B by choice, not by chance.

(With 50% HS reservation along with SC/ST/OBC reservation and now girls’ quota and EWS quota)IIITB CSE: 8000 (With no reservations)Which brings me to my first point — the peer group at IIITB would undoubtedly be better than at NIT Delhi due to the no-reservation factor. Even if you disregard reservations, the cutoffs are competitive. However, IIITB and NIT Delhi can be compared only on this parameter. In other parameters, IIITB is miles ahead.Campus:IIITB has a permanent campus with adequate accommodation facilities for its students. All academic facilities have air conditioning and the lecture halls are well equipped with modern projector systems, smartboards, lecture capture systems etc. The labs are modern and well equipped.NIT Delhi operates out of a temporary campus and relies on DTU and DU for many of its facilities.Curriculum:IIITB has core courses from the very first year. We studied Programming in C and Python, DSA, Digital Design, Networks, Calculus and Linear Algebra in the first year.I am not aware of NIT Delhi’s curriculum, but I expect it follows the standard pattern that is present at NITs i.e first year common for all branches.Placements:The median package offered to the iMTechs at IIITB was 17LPA in 2018.I am not able to find cent-per-cent reliable information about the placement scenario at NIT D. The best estimate I can find is an average of 10–12LPA.Now the question which must be weighing on your mind is: What if I want to do an MTech from the IITs? The answer to that is that if you wish to go into the corporate world, it is unlikely that you would be hindered during placements/job hunts if you have an iMTech from IIITB as opposed to [BTech from other than IIT/BITS/IIITH and MTech from IIT].Whether you can afford the fees of IIITB is a matter between you and your parents. Know that the institute provides scholarships as well — but if you are depending on them, confirm the terms and conditions with the institute before hand. If you cannot afford IIITB, I would recommend that you join any other well-established college which comes within your budget.

Despite this, it has achieved a lot in the span of three years. The main interaction that the first years would be having in Enigma is through the training programme they have in Arduino, the popular microcontroller technology that is used for hobbyist robotics and Internet-of-Things projects like smart home technologies. Apart from the Arduino programming interface, you would also learn about various sensors like IR and ultrasonic sensors and also about things like controlling motors using the Arduino. The culmination of this training programme is in a small project which must solve a given task. Last year's assignment was a line follower which was supposed to be capable of navigating a course with sharp turns. After this, there will be a round of interviews for induction into Enigma itself. If you are selected, you will be inducted into Enigma, where you will be allowed to work on institute-funded projects. One of the biggest advantages of being in the Enigma club is that it exposes you to different fields and pushes you to learn a lot on your own -- what you learn here can be transferred to research projects of your own and can help in internships etc as well. The mentorship for you to learn such things is very strong and the seniors are very approachable and also knowledgeble in these respects. (Side note: This approachability is not a thing unique to Enigma itself, but a characteristic of the senior-junior culture as a whole). Apart from this, Enigma also conducts seminars on various topics like Machine Learning, Signals and their Systems, Inter-Device Communication etc. It's not like you will learn the be-all and end-all about these subjects in these seminars (otherwise, why would we need full courses on them?). These are meant to expose you to a field you would probably have not much of an idea about. One thing you must understand is that IIITB's undergrad culture is very young and even among that, Enigma is one of the younger clubs. As such, you cannot expect the scale of the activities here to be on the same scale as, say, IIITH, BITS or the IITs. However, all the processes for the various activities have been established (very rapidly too, I might add) and all that remains is for more people to get involved in them. I hope the enthusiasm of iMT2019 will be even more than the enthusiasm of iMT2018 in this respect. In the end, it depends completely on you.

Beautiful and well maintained garden everywhere. Potted plants all around the campus, indoors and outdoors. A pond with flowing water over a rocky landscape surrounded by an artificially built ecosystem. Campus is well connected by BMTC buses. The location, Electronic city is green, clean and one of the pleasant regions of Bangalore. It's cooler (literally) than the rest of the city too.Faculty - Talented. Highly qualified. Very approachable and friendly. Ready to guide. One need to make good use of this opportunity and put in some effort by attending the lectures or atleast watching the recorded ones, doing a number of projects under the professors and also getting in touch with them to clear doubts.Food - Fairly good and healthy vegetarian food. Eggs on Wednesdays and Sundays. No non vegetarian food. Atleast twice a week there is live food counter with freshly made hot dishes. Sweet dish is provided almost everyday. Bread, jam and butter is provided everyday for breakfast. Chats, ice creams, khichadi,Chinese, south indian, north indian etc constitute the menu.On the academic front, apart from classes, there are Conferences, summer and winter schools, guest speakers and lectures, symposiums, technical exhibitions,honourable Indian and foreign delegate visits that happen regularly. Weekly talks by professors called Samvaad give insights about the research happening under a professor.Internship and job opportunities provided to students are great and also they keep getting better everywhere. These are opportunities and not guarantees. Hard work pays everywhere.Extra curricular activities have been pacing up. Clubs and committees are getting better. So are the celebrations like alumni day, foundation day etc. Students bodies have improved the way they organize these events. Lot of opportunity is available for team building, event organising and skill building. Although, there are a certain section of people who see that the clubs and events are not as good as in other colleges and sit around doing nothing to improve it other than offering their criticism. While, others see this as an opportunity to work hard , take initiatives and make the culture in the college better. College admins support continuously for all the student initiatives which makes all the difference.Hostels - Girls and boys hostles are separate.

This is a question I can answer, since my rank in JEE Main was 5353. The answer, however, depends on your Advanced rank and what you get through Advanced though. I can only talk about myself. This will be quite long. With my scores in Advanced and BITSAT, I had gotten BITS Hyderabad EE and IIT Palakkad EE . I did not prefer BITS much compared to IIT and IIIT as I did not feel like I would fit well in that culture, and there were some aspects I disliked. This was more related to my personality than anything. Of course if I had gotten Pilani this may have been different. As for IIT Palakkad, I was in fact inclined towards that 10 days before joining college as the last round of JoSAA had just concluded. But my cousin told me that new IITs were not preferred so much by companies and that his company did not go to any IIT beyond IIT Guwahati. Also, while it being a new college was not such a big problem, the fact that not even one batch had passed out yet and that there was no proper alumni support was also something that I thought about. I started to feel that in the case of 2015 IITs, ‘IIT brand’ was not a big enough factor to consider as compared to other well-established colleges. As for colleges which I could get with my Mains score, there was NIT Surathkal IT. I preferred CSE as compared to IT after seeing the curriculum of both. I was also more inclined towards IIIT, which I will finally come to now. The reasons I liked IIIT Bangalore are as follows: i) It had a good academic environment ii) Every professor has a PhD ( well, to my knowledge, almost every professor). And they were done from top institutions like MIT, CMU, Purdue, IISc, top IITs, etc. iii) Freedom of projects - this one I want to expand on because it was a deciding factor. When I visited the college for orientation, a senior told us that we could just go up to a professor and tell them an idea for a project. If they liked it, we could work with them and that we would not be judged based on GPA. Though I have not reached the stage where I can work with a professor, I can verify that our professors are very approachable, and I have indeed walked into their offices for help even without knowing who they were. iv) It being an Integrated MTech program let us explore the higher level concepts of Computer Science. v) There was a lot of scope to work on multiple fields related to computer science, and as I said, we get freedom to work on personal projects. For example, one of our seniors is going for a PhD on computational biology, another has gone to work on neural networks, and so on. vi) There was a good balance of industry and research. This left the option open for us to choose later. vii) Freedom, freedom, sweet freedom. I can’t stress this enough, but most of our professors, at least up till now, are pretty approachable. We are given a good amount of freedom to do what we wish to. ( seriously, even though the institute policy is 80% attendance most professors choose to set it lower, or at least are lax about getting less than that). We can even set up clubs pretty easily, all you have to do is tell the professor and get it approved. Quite a few of us set up clubs in the first year itself. Though some got disbanded due to the founders’ changing interests, it’s still impressive. These are the reasons I joined. And it’s been going pretty well until now :) A good answer I found : Aditya Paliwal's answer to How is coding culture at IIIT-Bangalore? Giving more insight into IIITB’s achievements. I’ve stayed away from directly speaking about those because they were not the factors which influenced me to join. I don’t want to paint an overtly rosy picture, but I’ve only spoken about what led me to join, not an overall review. There are quite a few negatives as well, which you can find on Quora.

The first batch got graduated in 2016 . Everyone got full time offer from companies like samsung qualcomm , bydesign . Students of first batch faced lot of problems for placements but in the end all got placed. 3.) The next batch 2015–2017 again everyone got full time offers and some new companies like IBM labs , Mediatek got added in the recruiter list. 4.) My batch 2016–2018 again everyone got full time offers and further new companies like western digital,synopsys, TCS R&D , Mathworks got added in the recruiter list 5.) 2017–2019 Right now 95% of the students are placed and i am sure the rest 5% will also be getting full time offers before the convocation. IIITB has now around 8–9 regular recruiters like Qualcomm , Mediatek , Samsung , IBM , Synopsys , Mathworks , Western Digital , TCS R&D etc and every year some new companies are also coming. So the point is because of amazing faculties,academic environment and hardworking students companies are showing confidence in IIITB. So may be this is the reason for increase in cutoff. PS VLSI Industry is very unpredictable Sometimes even in Top IITs students are left unplaced because of slow down in recruitment… The best example is last year Intel heavily recruited students and experienced professionals for development of 5G smartphone modem but few days back when apple signed deal with qualcomm Intel decided to exit the 5G smartphone modem business.

Now if you don’t really care about the branch, the next criteria you would be looking upon would be placements , research culture , coding culture , fee structure , extra curricular activities , peer group for which you can refer to Gauri Das's answer to Is IIIT Gwalior better than IIIT Bangalore ? Now why is ECE at IIITB worth taking ? The best thing over here in IIITB is the brilliance and experience of our faculty. The peer group is also awesome and very supportive. There are seniors who would always guide you and help you. The next brilliant thing here is the club “ENIGMA” which primarily focuses on circuits, electronics and all the ECE stuff . The members of the club are brilliant and have great knowledge and are always there to support people who need help. They take many classes and arrange workshops for students which are focused on the new stuff in the industry . The next brilliant thing here are the various opportunities one would get. They are many labs here for electronics related stuff and they are also many workshops conducted by the college . You can refer this link for one of the workshops | RISE 2019 The next thing here is the atmosphere . The atmosphere here is competitive and at the same time healthy. Though the no of cultural events here are very less, many events are being held which gives us some relief from the curriculum. Now coming to the topology of the college, the college is situated in the heart of the city , the silicon valley of India . The weather conditions are brilliant and peaceful. I don’t exactly know how IIIT Gwalior is , as it was never an option for me . But one thing you should keep in mind while taking the call should be that, you should go with the branch you want .

They are repeatedly saying that their Python instructor is an expert. But when you go through the material you will find out their definition of expertise and the standard of education that they have set. So my concern is that someone who doesn’t have basics of python cleared ,how can they make their career in Data Science. Also, Don’t go with the statistics that they show because you don’t know who is person who has got 72 lacs package from upgrad. At what level he/she was already on before attending their Course. Also, they have not mentioned whether the person is from Data Science Degree or any other degree because on their website you will find all the degrees including MBA, they have mentioned 72L as the highest salary. If you are changing you career at experience level of 2–3 years you can definitely get hike from 75% to 300% without any degree.

Can be used for all courses offered by Upgrad. Content Delivery: Till Data Structures the lectures were good. For Spring MVC, Hibernate and Backend development the content delivery was not upto the mark. Unable to meet the timeline due to lack of understanding. Sometimes I availed leaves to grasp the county and meet deadlines. Again the course delivery excelled when we began with Front End development and Advanced Front End development. That gave me a huge relief after giving feedbacks to Upgrad team for which they responded positively. Quiz & Assignments: Course assignments and personalised feedbacks were excellent to bridge the gaps I had. Quiz was moderate. Time Management: Very difficult if you don't act responsibly. Sometimes I felt it was unrealistic too for certain modules. I spent atleast 1–2 hours/day on weekdays to keep up the pace. Ever since I stepped on to Front end development module, we had employability tests that had stringent timelines in order to attend the placement they offer. If you fail in any one you'll lose Ur eligibility. So you must value your time and stay ahead of the module by atleast 1 week. Else you'll lose scores. Employability Tests: Not easy enough to crack elite company interviews. They ask you toughest questions before you become eligible. Programming questions haven’t matched much with the course module. Too much extra efforts have to be made to attend them. They're tough to crack with just course content. My verdict: As I did learn to manage my time efficiently, its Totally worth my time and effort to earn a degree from an institute like IIIT-Bangalore that adds value for freshers and working professionals. So, if you prepare yourself for these situations, you'll pass out with flying colours. My referral code is CHAI182 P.S: Weekend sacrifices are a must to complete the course with good grades.

Why PGD in ML&AI from IIIT-B with upGrad? Even though it’s an online course, it’s as rigorous as a classroom course would be. The only difference being that you have the choice of completing the modules as per your availability. Minimum investment of 15 - 20 hrs a week is required for you to do justice to the course as well as learn at your pace & also meet the weekly submission deadlines (which come with penalties if not adhered to).The course is not a run of the mill course being offered by any university. IIIT-B is one of the premier institutes within the Information Technology space & the course is one of the sought after ones given the recent uptick & demand for trained ML & AI professionals.You don’t get awarded the PGD if you just pay the fees & enroll. There are ongoing quizzes (as part of the modules), ongoing case-studies & assignment submissions, live sessions, etc. All these add up to your scores & meet the CGPA requirements to be “awarded” the PGD certificate - which you can rightfully claim.Constant support from teaching assistants, course-mates, industry experts (via live sessions) & your student mentor (for non-technical queries) are offered by upGrad - thereby ensuring you don’t feel lost in the new journey.Your expected commitments: Long term commitment (over a period of 11 months) is absolutely essential. Weekly module deadlines are sacrosanct & need adherence for ensuring completion of course & avoidance of penalties on submissions. This would entail that sometimes you miss out on social commitments, family time & other things.

The whole premise that led to UGEE was that every year there were a sizeable number of students who entered into Dual Degrees through JEE and were good at academics yet were simply not interested in research. The quality comes down because the student values graduating more than the research that he/she is conducting, they try to pick a lab where the professor is lite or the requirements are easy and so on. The institute wanted that quality research to be conducted and researchers are produced. There are many students who go on to do a Ph.D. in the respective field due to the interests they have developed.

I pursued this as PGDDA and now it has become PG in ML/AI. This course requires lot of hardwork , dedication and patience and is not to be taken for granted. Pursue it only if you are serious and genuinely interested for a career in Data Science. Also pursue it after you have explored all the other options on resources like Udemy,Datacamp etc since you get the same curriculum there. The Highlights of the Upgrad-IIITB PGDDA program are 1. Mentor Support - Personally enjoyed this mentor support very well. My mentor always supported and ensured that there was no issue that I was facing during my on-going PGDDA program here in Upgrad. Response was always prompt, mentor was also patient in hearing out my queries to action it accordingly. 2. Structure of Curriculum and hands on learning – The structure of the content stands out very well and as you traverse through different courses one after the other you observe that it is systematic in a certain sequence with exposure to real time cases from eminent industry experts like Mr.Anand from Gramener, Ms.Ujjaiyini from Viacom-18 etc to teach us a specific concept. 3. Assignment/Case Studies – This aspect is a double edge sword . At certain juncture of the course initially you may feel frustrated/drained out but the tight deadlines ensures you are disciplined with your study plan and makes learning more systematic and efficient. Test of character because learning all these skills via assignments and cases require patience, persistence and perseverance because it does not come easy atleast till you have a strong hold of the concepts. This is worth the effort if you have the right peers ,case-study team, study group who are like minded and committed then you are on a roll since peer interaction helps you learn more about many perspectives for one specific business problem. 4. Evaluation aspects – They are satisfactory which can still be enhanced on a consistent basis providing a standard solution with consistent feedbacks. 5. Faculties I will always be thankful to the following faculties at IIIT-B for enlightening us with their knowledge and expertise in their subjects. o Professor RC for giving me a clarity of thought as far as SQL, Dataware Housing, CRISP-DM framework is concerned. o Mr. Anand for his valuable insights on EDA coupled with the practicalities in the analytics industry. o Prof Tricha for strengthening our basics in Statistics and Hypothesis Testing. o Prof Dinesh Babu Jayagopi for effectively teaching us Linear and Logistic Regression in PA1 course with a brilliant thought process. o Ms.Ujjaiyini from Viacom-18 for her sharing industry learnings on Linear Regression and Model Selection. o Professor Raghavan for helping us with building a clear thought process with concepts like SVM, Random Forests and Decision Trees and on-going time series concepts etc. 6. Peers – Fortunate and thankful to find few genuine & committed peers who were always keen on learning and sharing their knowledge and experience. Succeeding in PGDDA program Regular study,Systematic schedule is the key to commence and complete this course successfully. Hope that helps. All the best.

First and foremost, just like anything else in the world, learning something required efforts to be put in. So, if you have the mindset that this will be just like your Bachelor's degree or something that you can get away with by paying the least attention, I'm sorry, you're wrong. I wouldn't recommend this to someone who can't make at least 14 hours per week for 11 months straight without any exceptions. And it's a long time if you're not really dedicated/interested/passionate about this. Let's say you are willing to devote your energy and time to the course properly, we shall talk about certain things in detail. Spoiler Alert : This is obviously my personal PoV, so, some might disagree with it completely, but here I go, nonetheless. The program is very clearly/strategically structured to help students have a clear view of how we're flowing through the content of the course. There are a lot of things to be covered and the proper distribution and classification doesn't let anything clutter up and be meaningless.The recorded video lectures in between the sessions give you ample understanding of whatever is being taught. All the speakers are either faculties of IIIT-Bengaluru or Senior Professionals from their respective industries.The quizzes in between the videos (yes, there are objective AND subjective questions in middle of the videos to test your understanding of whatever is being taught) are very relatable and help us interact with the course so that we don't feel like we're just reading an article or watching a video off from YouTube.The assessments at the end of each session and the assignments at the end of most of the modules are something that help us accumulate all that we've learnt and apply it in solving some real-world problems. This is undoubtedly very crucial and very important.The batches formed by the students and mentors are really helpful. I'm assuming that all the batches have equally helpful people in them as I had in mine. Taking the concept of “sharing is caring”, the students get their doubts cleared by internal discussions, share feedbacks and even help others by providing external resources to reference to.The live sessions talk about the usefulness of whatever we're studying in the real market and how to shape our careers accordingly. Although I found most of the live sessions to be pretty irrelevant because they talk about a very vast domain of jobs and careers and you start to feel abandoned somewhere in the middle. What's good is that every live session is recorded and you can watch it anytime later on YouTube. (Seek dude, seek).The student mentors are the biggest plus of this course for me. They are the most human thing about the course. If you are in a certain situation, they'll leave no stone unturned to help you out in one way or the other.I'll leave you to judge. Whichever parameters you might wanna put in your priority list accordingly. I feel like I haven't talked about so much even now so if you have any queries, please let me know and I'll try to help you out in a Q&A session.

Needed to adjust finances and also had to work on my coding skills in the mean time to be at par with the hiring bar at Amazon in Software Dev - this I could never do, that’s where IIIT & upGrad comes into my life as saviors of my ‘dream’. While I’m a very fast learner and have also applied for like tons of online courses, not been able to complete even like ‘1’ of them. Came across upGrad’s course that they’re offering in coordination with IIIT-B. At first, the IIIT was what caught my attention, else I would think of it as any other online course that I won’t be able to complete but pay like hefty amount, so, ‘would’ leave it. So, initially it wasn’t the upGrad, it was for the IIIT I paid for the course, and then we had the upGrad’s onboarding session, it was since the start these guys continued to impress me with the way they are conducting the classes. With time, I never seize to get impressed, to name a few things which I’ve liked about this course are: The content the deadlines the modules course design in-class questions that ensure you have attention on the content the Grades and Graded questions - this is enticing, trust me. Non-completion penalties lol GPA system then Industry demonstrations Assignments, plus they conduct the live sessions, they offer career services Resume services Interviews with leading companies, at least 3 are promised to you. You have Interview Content available at the same time that you need to complete while doing the course itself. You have student mentors - they remind you of your progress and share your standings in your batch(they call the batch - ‘Cohort’). You simply have no option but to learn, understand the concepts, implement them in the programming questions that are given in the middle of the course at multiple places. It’s kinda like real University high quality course available to you, but virtually, you can do it from your home or office. You get a welcome kit with IIIT-Tshirt and all(I’m still waiting for mine lol). So, good thing is, you can’t move to next session unless you complete the previous ones and then you also have a deadline, this will make you complete the course while ensuring you’re not skipping parts and learning all the concepts, this feature with all the above makes this course stand out. The problem with all the other great online courses is: No Deemed University affiliation/certification, they are self paced with no tracking, no penalty on non-completion, no deadlines which means no one to ask so you’re always a lazy ass lol and ain’t gonna complete it ever, or a certification from good Uni like IIIT. If you’ve for long wanted to learn Software and transit to Software Industry, not been able to or if you’d like to just move to software, as far as I’m concerned, I’d say Go For It!!! If you’re a complete novice - just a quick one here, while they offer everything from the scratch, a tip would be that you try to have a little bit of basic knowledge of coding or have a coding book with you for reference, this would be a plus.

Also, I got a scholarship for being still young.. :p I am 5 months into this 11 month program (Software Development - Blockchain Technology - Upgrad + IIIT B), thus, I must be eligible to give my review and help you. The course pedagogy is really good. This course is fast paced and dives into the right technical depth of a subject. I am impressed with the flow and the way theory is amalgamated with real life examples, which are also demonstrated by Industry practitioners. Mandatory questions, which pop up between the video lecture, helps the student grasp understanding of the concept more efficiently. The only way to complete this course is dedication and there is no possible escape to the knowledge delivered. Thus, this is the right tool, if you really want to be learn a subject. It beats procrastination. The mentors in Upgrad team are very professional and helpful. Also, the videos are clear and IIIT B professors are able to communicate the content very clearly. The course doesn't directly start with Blockchain concepts. Indeed it is nowhere in the picture after 5 months. As I am moving forward with the course, I realise that the content is carefully choosen to build a strong base. The queries are timely resolved and extra sessions are arranged as demanded by majority of cohort. The interview material is also beneficial to sharpen the understanding. Moreover, we can download summary notes and discuss with peers on discussion board. Hope this helps.

I had a call with Upgrad personnel and some one from IIIT-B (I remember) during which they explained me in detail about how they have actually designed the course and how they were planning to execute the same. The course was divided into parts - Few imp ones are explained 1.Foundations of JAVA, Data Structures and Algorithms ( After nearing the course completion and having worked in an internship and attending couple of interviews and a year of market research and actually learning the concepts , I really feel these 3 courses form the foundation for any programmer who really wants to be good at programming.) 2. Backend (MVC,Spring & RESTful API’s)This part makes a programmer a good Backend developer in the field of web development. 3. Frontend( HTML,CSS,JS & REACT.JS) This is to become a Front end Developer. If one could understand and be good at both backend and frontend he/she will be eligible to work in any organization as a Full Stack Web Developer as the title of the course says. What I learnt after the call was , The course curriculum offers a chance to pursue career in three roles , Back end developer, Front end Developer & Full Stack Developer (All of the jobs are in high demand in the current market ) We will be given a lot of Hands on training and various kinds of assessments to judge our understanding of the course. And Mentor ship and Placement services.  After hearing to all of the above , I decided to take the course .Now after 11 months of my journey with Up grad and IIIT-B , I am totally convinced that I have made one of my best decisions in order to uplift my career and I am expecting a 100% plus growth in my career as it was one year before.  Please refer to the first comment by “Tenneti Srinivas” that was given on the question where all the services offered by Upgrad & IIIT-B’s Full Stack Web Development course are listed and explained in detail.

It will be very hard for you to top your class, or even be average AT BEST. The problem that arises here is that there are no reservations here( yeah right! I called no reservations a problem. why? read ahead) because everyone here has the same knowledge, or atleast they are on the same level, as compared to NITs or IITs, where 50% of the students have come in through reservations, the non-reserved students already have an advantage over them, so no matter what, in IITs or NITs, a general candidate can easily be in the top 50% of the class with some grade X, but with the same grade X, you might even land in the bottom 20% at IIITB.So, competition is slick and the place is filled with people trying to out best each other, so if you’re looking NOT to study or have a chill undergraduate study, please join other colleges.",0.23532499999999998,Positive,3.47065,0.03773584905660377,1,4.47065,3.47065

It has had 100% Placement record all the years since its establishment in 1999. The Placement process covers both Internship and Full-Time Employment (FTE). The Placement season, for both internships and jobs, opens in August every year. The companies and the institute get in touch with each other and fix a date for conducting the exam (written test). The students qualifying in this have a GD (Group Discussion) round. Some companies directly call the students in for technical interviews. Students selected in this round go for the HR interview. Soon after the HR round, the qualified students are required to sign the Offer Letter. Thus, is the Placement procedure. Pioneer companies in the Information Technology sector like Google, Amazon, Flipkart, Accenture, HSBC, HP, IBM, Infosys, Intel, Tata Power, Morgan Stanley, Cisco etc. have been visiting the campus for many years now. The college takes pride in the displaying the Placement statistics to the public. All the statistics are given in detail on the official website. The candidates getting into these Information Technology giants are highly paid. Many students prefer to go for higher studies and hence, opt out from the Placement process. Though, the majority of the students studying in the institute go for corporate jobs in one of the prestigious companies while the others go for academics or Research and Development (R&D). IIIT-B has enjoyed excellent placement for all the 18 batches of M.Tech students who have graduated so far. Of the 1396 alumni, a few have gone for doctoral studies at MIT, UC Berkeley, Indiana University, University of Washington and Syracuse University in USA, Paderborn and University of Kaiserslautern in Germany, Trento in Italy and IIIT-B and BITS Pilani in India.

The course structure at IIITB is such that you learn core CSE and ECE content from the very first year. The faculty is top-notch and very approachable and free of bias. A major advantage of IIITB ECE is that you share the first two years with CSE, giving you ample common courses like Programming, DSA etc. Further, you have a 60–40 split between branch electives and open electives. The peer group is very good at IIITB. The admission process is through JEE Main and is reservation-free. There are students from all across the country and from all backgrounds at IIITB.

Entirely online programs do not fall under either of these modes.Additionally, at least one batch should have passed out of the program for it to be offered online.According to the UGC (Online Courses) Regulations, 2018, online Programmes requiring Practical/ Laboratory Courses as a curricular requirement shall not be permitted.The Higher Education Institute can offer the Online Course or Programme subject to it obtaining approval by the appropriate statutory authorities or bodies such as the UGC. Approval of the statutory bodies under The University Grants Commission Act, 1956 or the memorandum of association governing the Higher Education Institute for offering the course or program through the online mode.As per the regulations, only non-technical courses can be offered online. Online Courses or Programmes in the field of engineering, law, medicine, dental, pharmacy, nursing, architecture, physiotherapy, applied arts cannot be offered through the online mode.The institute should have access to SWAYAM or other platforms for learner authentication (i.e. integration with AADHAAR or other government recognized identity for Indian students (and passport for foreign students), learner registration.For a Diploma, the duration of the Online Course or Programme should be for a minimum of one year with at least forty credits.The HEI can provide one or more academic sessions each year which begin either in July/August or January/February each year.Currently, IIIT B does not offer any Diploma degrees.

I got a good mentor, he kept on pushing and reminding me for deadlines with notification and nice messages. Now, coming to your question, the market hasn’t evolved as the hype. My personal belief is, ML and AI are very powerful but not magic. They have their own limitations. Not everything can be done. There are not enough people in Mid level management that are skillful enough to understand what ML can do and can’t do and create space for new employees. They do have a placement program but I didn’t find it good. There isn’t enough demand in the market for our expectations. They do circulate all the opportunities via. mail though.

I am a full time employee since the last 6 year so it was pretty challenging. I took out an hour daily after office where i would sit and view the lectures. Also many times i would download the videos and watch them if i was commuting.During the weekend i tried to finish off the quiz and also work on the assignment if any.I was in constant touch with my cohort and mentor. In case i felt i had some issue or needed some time extra i reached out to the team and they would do their best to get some extra time.

However right now there is a wave of people learning ML and AI and that pool is also getting congested very quickly. This made me realize that by the time i will get a degree in ML, i will again face challenges in proving myself. Which led me to explore more deeply into Blockchain. I will jot down the main reasons i went for Upgrad Blockchain PGD: As mentioned above Blockchain for Business is a new technology so the competition is low.Many Government bodies and Banks are looking into Blockchain solutions. So I expect a boom in job openings soon.The application of blockchain is HUGE!! It is not limited to Bitcoin. In fact Bitcoin is not even 5 % of Blockchain. Blockchain for business is a hell of an opportunity to uncover! That is something people have not yet tapped into. Feel free to google “Blockchain for Business”. A good example that comes to mind is the E- Estonia Model.I recently submitted my capstone for the PGD and i can now safely write down the pros and cons of this course: PROS: Its not just about Blockchain. First few months covered Software Development. Even though i have been doing Development work for almost 6 years now but i learnt so much during that time. Right from OOPS down to Spring Hibernate. Everything is covered efficiently.There are a plethora of course assignments. Which are evaluated to the T and the remarks provided are both constructive and comprehensive.There’s a lot of videos just capturing the Interview questions which i found to be very helpful.My cohort in particular was very responsive and the mentor was very helpful too.We also got 1 year subscription of all Jetbrains products which was a nice add-on.I will get an Alumni status from IIIT-B. That surely wont hurt.Finally the most important pro:Blockchain is covered extensively. By the end of this PG i have created end to end projects in Ethereum(1), Hyperledger Fabric(2). That includes the Network setup, the Smart Contracts and Chaincode development, Dockers setup and even the ExpressJS setup of Blockchain which makes the backbone of DAPPS.The architecture and the importance of Blockchain is well covered. It’s easy to understand how blockchain works in a layman term. Sure its just a decentralized system, but when it comes to the nitty gritty of it. There is so much to know!I also learnt a lot about NodeJS and Solidity. This has definitely helped me in becoming a more proficient developer.CONS: Networking on the whole is low. Mostly it will all be online classes. That can be increased.The course is frigging rigorous. If you think you can skim through, then, my friend you have taken the wrong course. :DFinally to summarize, This course is a good stepping stone to learn everything there is to know about Blockchain. Like any other course, how much you learn from it is 100% up to you. Hope this helped you a little in making an informed discussion. Reach out to me if you need any further info or if you are interested to know about any certain aspect of Blockchain. Would be happy to help. :) Stay Safe and Keep Learning. Cheers!!

Hence suggest you prefer CSE over IT. Next IIIT is offering 5 year MTech which means you will not have hassels of writing GATE etc for a MTech Seat. Plus you are getting PG in 5 years instead of 5–1/2 years. W r.t campus placements IIIT being a premier institute focussed in Computer field would attract better companies. Our best wishes.

You can do further research about purchasing power parity yourself, there are plenty of sites available online. After taking into account the cost of living and taxes, this is equivalent to a slightly better than average salary for a CS grad in India. Moreover, many job offers also include one-time bonuses which inflate the reported figure.

There are two autonomous, student run bodies at IIIT Bangalore that are the driving force of the institute’s coding culture. a) CAMP - Club for Algorithms Math & Programming - This club primarily focuses on competitive programming and prepares students for the ACM ICPC which is widely considered as the “Olympics” of programming. The club began operating in 2017 and receives guidance from the instructor of the Data Structures and Algorithms course Members of the club conduct regular lectures on advanced problem solving techniques in Math, Data Structures and Algorithms for first and second year iMTech students to introduce them to the world of competitive programming. In December 2017, two teams from iMTech second year managed to qualify for the “regionals”, i.e., the semi-final stage of the ACM ICPC with just a single semester’s worth of training from CAMP. Moreover, within just 2 years of CAMP being established, IIIT-B has managed to qualify for the ACM ICPC World Finals twice - in 2017 and 2018. We were one of 140 teams that managed to qualify from over 100 countries on 6 continents and more than 50,000 participating students. Let’s put things into perspective by comparing this with other Indian institutes - NITs - Out of 31 NITs, NITK and NIT Trichy are the only NITs to have qualified for the World Finals, once each in 2017 and 2010 respectively.IITs - Out of 16 IITs only 8 have managed to qualify for the World Finals since 2010. These are IIT Bombay, Delhi, Kanpur, Kharagpur, Madras, Roorkee, Indore and Patna.IIITs - IIIT Hyderabad and IIIT Allahabad are the only other IIITs apart from IIITB to have qualified for the World Finals since 2010.b) Zense - This club primarily focuses on software development and open source contribution and prepares students for the Google Summer of Code (GSoC) and Rails Girls Summer of Code (RGSoC) and encourages them to participate, organise and win in national level hackathons. Operating since 2014, Zense is a prime example of IIIT Bangalore’s coding culture. You can check out their projects here and here. Primarily due to the efforts of Zense, 10 students from the institute were selected for the GSoC program in 2017. Continuing their streak this year, 9 students have been selected for the GSoC program and 2 students for the RGSoC program. Moreover, members of Zense regularly conduct knowledge sharing sessions where students come together to conduct tutorials on the latest technologies and trends in development. Thanks to the institute being located in Bangalore, there is never a shortage of hackathons for students to take part in and students from Zense are typically leaders in the pack . Some of the Hackathons won by members of Zense include (this list is not exhaustive) - Civic Hackathon organized by the Janaagrah FoundationWipro Digital Hackathon2nd Runners up at INGENIUS Hackathon2nd Runners up at IIM Bangalore Policy HackathonFinalists at Microsoft Capture the FlagMoreover, the club enjoys support of the institute to conduct its own hackathons as well! In conclusion, even though the institute is still in the nascent stages of the iMTech program, students of IIIT Bangalore enjoy a top-tier programming culture.

Think of it like this, if you want to be job/interview ready and are willing to put the hard work that goes into it, then the answer is absolutely yes, you will find yourself in a favourable position in 11 months. You will be assigned a dedicated “Student Success Mentor”, one-on-ones with whom will prove extremely beneficial. You would have your needs catered to personally. You’ll also have several sessions with industry mentors, which will help you further be job ready. With upGrad’s course, you will be equipped with 500+ hours of content and 9 different assignments. This will prepare you with in-depth knowledge of the subject. The basics will be emphasized more than anything else, which I think is more important for a developer than all the fancy high-level stuff. If you already have a job, this will give you a significant boost in your career. And if you’re a complete fresher, there’s still not much to worry about.

Jobs are immense once you become 2years experienced professional. Freshers might find tough to into analytics space so better is gain experience for 2-3yrs side by side start your learning and after some years, go for interview and Get into your analytics life. Salary as per analytics india magazine is as follows:- 0-4years experienced folks with all knowledge of r, python, excel can earn upto 10-12lacs that too from big shot mncs whereas startups will give u around 5-8lacs depending upon the nature and status of the startup. I would suggest you to first learn by doing, go for internships in a startups to gain lots of exposure in all aspects of technologies and real world issues and them jump onto big mncs with your wider skillsets. Coming to the courses mentioning below check it:- There are many other options which are having less fees, quality education, rich content as per latest market scenerio.

The courses at iim, isb and praxis are very well structured and delivered and all are preferable for atleast 2yrs experienced folks but they are all distance learning courses via VLP mode. They are fabulous in their contents, facilities, faculties, support,brand.. If you are from anywhere from india go for praxis launched recently enabled online course they are best by far less cost and rich contents with great placement support after 6months duration. Believe me placement is also there even for online course offered by praxis business school.Praxis has thrived hard to be the best in all terms whether it is online or offline specially in data science domain in india or in asia for providing cutting edges practices....

They’ll say they have cut off through an entrance exam, again a lie, it doesn’t matter what you score in that exam, you’ll still get entry into the program. There are literally 1000s of students passing out from this program every year. So you can understand how diluted the effect of IIIT-Bangalore title is soon going to be. Every other Indian on Linkedin has IIIT-Bangalore PG Diploma attached to their profile. Out of the 300 students, the cohort of my batch, only 7 got placed. There is no fixed cohort size they have increased to a bigger value now, they keep taking in people in their program. Their placement promise is gimmickry. They’ll keep introducing some cooler upgrad titles and programs that’ll help you get ‘placed’. The company list(for placements) is a simple web scraping of http://naukri.com and Job Search India | Indeed, that’s pretty much it. Then you’ll get another call from upgrad, “Congrats! you are not a part of upgrad’s super SPECIAL placement cell!”, and so on, every 2 weeks you’ll be added into something “SPECIAL”. In the end, you won't be placed, its nonsense marketing tactics to make you feel like upgrad is doing justice to the huge 2.8 Lac rupees you paid. Online courses zoom you through the content, whereas in interviews core foundational questions are asked, which usually requires you to dive deeper into the statistics and work a lot with projects on Kaggle etc.. You must learn R, Python and SAS, to be employable. Especially Python. Upgrad programme teaches you R and then, throws in some optional lectures on Python.(which is utterly useless, because you’ll find 100x better content on youtube for free) Just to let you know, every online programme teaches you 35+ projects, and all the projects along with their answers are available everywhere on the internet. World of Data Science is like this, you’ll soon discover on your own, trust me. In fact, Upgrad’s every project(including the project’s answers) are available on GitHub. Every Data Science batch copies the codes of the previous batch and passes through many assignments and projects in the program. in other words, upgrad doesn’t even change the questions nor projects, it’s just a copy-paste that is being taught to 10000+ students with cooler marketing ads every year. In the end, this IIIT_Bangalore tag won’t add much to your resume if you are entering with the idea that this will give your resume a big college title and chance to interview with top companies. No. You can do that with a much cheaper course as well. (Dude there are literally 1000s of certificate courses in DS in the market these days) A last note: You want to get into DS, right? Learn R, Python, Tableau/Microsoft BI, SQL, Pyspark and Hive. SAS is also important especially if you want to enter Medical DS/Finance DS for big institutions. Practice a lot of projects from kaggle, github etc.. watch seminar videos related to DS on youtube and try to understand how complex problems are solved through DS, and apply that mentality when dealing with datasets, it takes some time and getting used to. A sort of statistician’s mindset. Also, your objective should be to immediately get an internship in the field. Because real-world datasets are most important, in order to improve your DS skills and hence your position in the market.

No need to read the hard work of mine. ;) My credentials as a reviewer of this course: I am currently pursuing this course(almost finished). A bit of introduction about oneself won’t hurt I believe. I am a software developer (BE from an average private institute) working mainly with Microsoft technologies (not in Microsoft yet), having 12 years of experience. Just a random normal guy basically. I will dissect this course in comparison to other courses available in market so that anybody reading would get a comparative analysis, rather than absolute bum kissing of this course. Let’s mention important parameters on which I had evaluated this whole ML/AI upskilling journey, not essentially in order. a. Course Price It demands money for sure. So does ‘Great Learning’ course giving you the similar diploma after 11 months run. Smaller courses charge less money. Some other similar courses charge even more money. You decide how much you want to spend ! For me, the money charged is fine as it was less than other courses in which I was interested. b. Entrance Exam I like it when institutes at least try to make it harder for individuals to just directly pay money and join the courses. Upgrad and IIITB conducted entrance exam for me. It may be a false sense instilled in me but this is how I like it so I was happy to give the entrance exam. Others were ready to omit the entrance test. Sadly I have heard that Upgrad has as well offered seat without entrance test. I wonder why would they do like this. May be the candidate was really brilliant. Not sure though. c. Learning Platform I can compare ‘Great Learning’ one with Upgrad’s. I feel Upgrad’s one is better and it brings a certain amount of freshness in terms of look and feel. As well, one thing which really impressed me about studying at Upgrad’s Learning Platform is that you cannot move forward in your course unless you have really watched and finished the current video and other reading, quiz material. It makes you cry sometimes but it’s fine as it is for your own good. d. Course Content I wanted certain topics in ML/AI which I really wanted to study so those were offered by Upgrad. Otherwise Course content and delivery by IIITB professors/Industry experts, I would say is similar to other institute like Great Learning so not a big difference in value addition by Upgrad. Upgrad and IIITB has done a tremendous job in curating the course, it’s amazing. e. Assignment/Case Studies Upgrad is better than other shorter courses like Analytics Lab etc. Even Upgrad’s assignments projects are just toy examples but they really build your basic skills so that you can go out and try to solve bigger problems on your own. No complaints here. ‘Great Learning’ one is similar to Upgrad here. f. End Term Exams I can bet this is toughest among all courses here at Upgrad and IIITB. You really have to devote time to get decent marks in these exams. There are 3 exams conducted by IIITB so I like that they are not so average tests. I would have hated it if these were merely to give an illusion of test. Reality is these 3 exams are not so easy. Big hoot for Upgrad and IIITB here. g. Industry Experts/Career Counselling I know for a fact that this is available with all the similar duration courses. So this really did not make a difference in selecting Upgrad. h. Course Duration and Online/Offline I really wanted to learn nicely so I wanted a formal education syllabus. I was ready to invest my time but I needed some deadlines for each learning session. I had earlier tried MOOC like Udemy and Coursera but all in vain. As well, I wanted to learn Online without leaving my current job. So I analyzed few contenders could be Great Learning, Upgrad, DataCamp, Some universities of US, etc. I selected Upgrad for all the reasons I am mentioning in this post. I really believe that this program by Upgrad and IIITB is in many ways a bit tougher than other courses in market so you get a sense of achievement when you clear the modules, pass the university exams, get good grade, etc. There were couple of more parameters on which I had taken this decision but the gist of any course available is that choose any course and commit yourself for learning. Any of the course will not make you ready to tackle real life projects/problems. That’s not how it works in life. What this course(I am sure) or any other course(hopefully) will do is equip you with essential skills, enable you and put you in right track where learning becomes a regular affair and you start looking at things differently and start believing that yes, slowly you will be able to build something intelligent.

So, for any professional course, there are basically 2 objectives – Learn fundamentals that can be used later for professional work.To actually facilitate the student to get the job in the required field.UpGrad by IIIT Bangalore covers most of the fundamental topics that are required to get you started with ML and AI, it also covers some basic mathematics, python and SQL training. I have found this course to be really elaborate, they even have many optional topics in the course which you can study later depending on your curiosity towards topic or need to research and invent. They have tried to frame a course for “Everyone”. You also get access to this content for the next 3 years, at least this is what has been told to me, policies do change so please confirm before joining. I personally like the content quality and can recommend it to others, though there are some more topics, which I wish, were part of this course like cloud and Spark. Course costs 4.85 Lakhs which is too much (in Bangalore my colleague is paying 75k for nursery for his daughter xD ), but for me, since I didn’t want to leave my job for a full-time degree (and I know the cost of private institutions ) it’s justified. Please note that this is not a certification course similar to what you get on Udemy or Coursera, it offers you PG Diploma from IIIT Bangalore and MSc from LJMU. So please don’t compare the course with anything offered by those online websites. But again, since this is a professional course it comes with some strict rules, like submission deadlines. Some students don’t like that and no one can help with that. I have devoted almost (there are some buffer weeks also) all of my weekends for finishing all the content before the deadline, still, situations arise which can cause delayed submission or syllabus completion, leading to a penalty of 30% marks. Also, there were multiple live sessions done by industrial professionals for doubt resolution and project or assignment consultation, but to be honest IIIT B lectures are far better than most of those sessions. Regarding communication, I have a Whatsapp group (with all my batchmates in it, created by Upgrad guys handled a student mentor). Apart from that you continuously get emails regarding all necessary events, tests, and companies visiting the campus. You can also ask questions on the forum and I will have to say that the forum is pretty responsive, students and mentors both actively respond to the queries (apart from some unusual exceptions). About career support – Upgrad tries to help by arranging calls with industrial professionals, mock tests and also sessions on Linkedin and resume. But ultimately, like with all the courses, it boils down to the sincerity of the candidate and requirement in the market. Usually, companies that recruit from Upgrad offer 7-15 LPA, if you are from some NIT or IIT or with some experience (3-5 years) you might already be having this package if not and you find it lucrative then good for you. For professionals like a project lead or project manager (experience 7+ and 13+ years), I have seen Upgrad conducting some sessions to help to switch domain. Though I am not entirely sure about the available opportunities, you can definitely get some new skills to enrich your value within your organization or to make a switch within the organization if that is possible where you work. If you are passionate about working in this domain, I believe you will be smart enough to find your way. ",0.4059440000000001,Positive,3.811888,0.42452830188679247,1,4.811888,3.811888

There are literally 1000s of students passing out from this program every year. So you can understand how diluted the effect of IIIT-Bangalore title is soon going to be. Every other Indian on Linkedin has IIIT-Bangalore PG Diploma attached to their profile. Out of the 300 students, the cohort of my batch, only 7 got placed. There is no fixed cohort size they have increased to a bigger value now, they keep taking in people in their program. Their placement promise is gimmickry. They’ll keep introducing some cooler upgrad titles and programs that’ll help you get ‘placed’. The company list(for placements) is a simple web scraping of http://naukri.com and Job Search India | Indeed, that’s pretty much it. Then you’ll get another call from upgrad, “Congrats! you are not a part of upgrad’s super SPECIAL placement cell!”, and so on, every 2 weeks you’ll be added into something “SPECIAL”. In the end, you won't be placed, its nonsense marketing tactics to make you feel like upgrad is doing justice to the huge 2.8 Lac rupees you paid. Online courses zoom you through the content, whereas in interviews core foundational questions are asked, which usually requires you to dive deeper into the statistics and work a lot with projects on Kaggle etc.. You must learn R, Python and SAS, to be employable. Especially Python. Upgrad programme teaches you R and then, throws in some optional lectures on Python.(which is utterly useless, because you’ll find 100x better content on youtube for free) Just to let you know, every online programme teaches you 35+ projects, and all the projects along with their answers are available everywhere on the internet. World of Data Science is like this, you’ll soon discover on your own, trust me. In fact, Upgrad’s every project(including the project’s answers) are available on GitHub. Every Data Science batch copies the codes of the previous batch and passes through many assignments and projects in the program. in other words, upgrad doesn’t even change the questions nor projects, it’s just a copy-paste that is being taught to 10000+ students with cooler marketing ads every year. In the end, this IIIT_Bangalore tag won’t add much to your resume if you are entering with the idea that this will give your resume a big college title and chance to interview with top companies. No. You can do that with a much cheaper course as well. (Dude there are literally 1000s of certificate courses in DS in the market these days) A last note: You want to get into DS, right? Learn R, Python, Tableau/Microsoft BI, SQL, Pyspark and Hive. SAS is also important especially if you want to enter Medical DS/Finance DS for big institutions. Practice a lot of projects from kaggle, github etc.. watch seminar videos related to DS on youtube and try to understand how complex problems are solved through DS, and apply that mentality when dealing with datasets, it takes some time and getting used to. A sort of statistician’s mindset. Also, your objective should be to immediately get an internship in the field.

The reasons that one should join IIITB are as follows: Placements: The median placement for the second batch was 17LPA. This already puts IIITB toe-to-toe with the top NITs’ CSE.Curriculum: We learnt Programming in C and Python, DSA, Calculus, Linear Algebra, Digital Design and Networks in the first year. This puts us at least a year ahead compared to other colleges’ curricula. The curriculum undergoes constant improvement and new electives are always being added.Faculty: The faculty at IIITB are highly technically competent, up to date, approachable, and down-to-earth.No-reservation culture: This has a big impact on peer group quality and this has a big difference on the competitive spirit of every batch.The senior-junior culture: The culture here is one of mutual respect and companionship.Mentorship by the clubs: Let me put it this way. The robotics club has a programme for the first years for introduction to Arduino and its peripherals. They also conduct lectures introducing topics like ML. The competitive programming club conducts lectures on programming and CP in particular. The software development club conducts seminars on game development etc.Nobody is going to spoonfeed you here. They will just introduce the various topics which are not something you would be exposed to. But yes, you will have a lot of guidance.The clubs are also young, so don’t expect the activities to be on the scale of the old IITs, BITS and the NITs. The seniors are really putting a lot of efforts in quickly bringing the clubs up to the desired level. It also depends on the level of participation from the juniors, which is constantly improving.Bangalore. Being in the IT hub of India has an impact on internships and placements. The out-of-campus life is better here, with Forum mall half an hour to 45 minutes away. Healthcare facilities are good, and the college has recently made a tie-up with Narayana for an ambulance facility.However, this doesn’t mean IIITB is some kind of nirvana or mecca. Cons: Brand value: People within the industry are (now) somewhat aware of IIITB, but outside it, zilch. If brand value matters to you, consider another institute.Rigour: This is good and bad, but if you are not interested in working hard, IIITB is not the place for you. One-night study is not enough for most exams. There will be plenty of projects and assignments, too. The coursework is rigorous.Small campus: The infrastructure quality is good, but the small campus hinders sports and fest activities at times. However, the ability to leave your hostel room 90 seconds before your class starts is something the members of bigger campuses may envy.",0.178290625,Positive,3.35658125,0.018867924528301886,1,4.35658125,3.35658125

Which is better, IIITB ECE or BITS EEE Hyderabad? I myself and 2 others in my batch got BITs and IIITB same branch and chose IIITB. So coming to your question, you mentioned that you actually wanted CSE. In IIITB’s 5 year iMtech program, the first 2 years is common. ECE and CSE students study the same subjects. So even ECE students study all the core fundamentals of CS. After that we chose are electives. So if you are an ECE student you have to chose minimum 60% of electives from your branch and and 40% from the other branch. So you can study computer science too. And the research environment here will help prepare you for further studies. Faculty Both Bits and IIITB faculty are good. IIITB fares better. Opportunities I would say there are more opportunities in IIITB due to industry proximity and location. Also the research environment here will increase your opportunities. Brand Name BITs has a strong established brand name. IIIT-B brand name isn’t far behind though. It’s brand name is mostly in academic circles and industry. The general public aren’t aware of it. Branch Change In BITs branch change is based on your first year’s GPA. In IIITB as of now there is no branch change. There have been talks for branch change for your branch onwards but nothing has been confirmed. Peer Group Both colleges don’t have reservation or management seats, so peer group will be amazing in both. Peer group in BITs would probably be better due to higher cut offs. So it all comes down to your priorities, you strike to me as an academic oriented person like me, if it is so then you can chose IIITB. If you are sports/cultural person then you can chose BITs.

They will always encourage you in terms of moral support as they know what’s the amount of positive energy their motivation fills juniors with. It is not just motivation or help in terms of your academics. My super seniors helped us to plan our treks, parties and even suggest best dining places. Sometimes we used to go with our seniors for some concerts and movies, and you know what the fun part is? You don’t have to go through the trouble of planning and managing tickets, seniors will take care of it… XD You ask me the most happening place in the campus, I would definitely say, it’s our small little cafeteria not because of it’s snacks but because this the place where we get to interact with our seniors the most. Believe me, poking and teasing our seniors by spamming of social media is the best feeling ever. Basically all I am trying to say is, outside the classroom everyone of us are friends more like buddies. Just consider them as your own cousins. Well, why cousins and not siblings???

I presume, that depends on the atmosphere you find in the university. And the atmosphere here is surprisingly productive. SAC. Students Accounts Committee, as they would call the Students liaison to the admistration of the college. Although I was always sceptical of the “change” you can bring to the way “major” decisions are taken in IIITB, it provides an indispensable platform to voice your concerns and make sure the top echelons of decision making pyramid are taking notice. I have met SAC of 2012 batch (my batch), 2011 and 2012 iMTech. SAC members are elected democratically in an election held in the first 1–2 months of 1st year. SAC election and its associated campaigning comprised some of the best days I can remember in my college days. Tutoring. One thing I badly missed from my BTech days, was the tutoring medium/platform where seniors and juniors sit together and help each other out when needed. You will hardly notice people who show any visible signs of pride because they were good at something. If someone knows something you want to know, go ahead and seek help, and you will get what you want.

No they won’t. So it’s solely on us, how this Institute is rated in nearby future.

Why? The faculty of PEC consits of Assistant professors who are currently pursuing PhD in that college itself (some other colleges also) where as faculty at IIIT B is much more reputed in the field of academia as all of them have graduated PhD from premiere institutes across the world like MIT, Carnegie Mellon University, Purdue University, UC Berkeley, IISc Bangalore and IITs. So the faculty at IIITB​ is a lot better in comparison.IIIT Bangalore's coding culture is far too impressive. You can look at the Zense Club for instance. Also, apart from Zense, a lot of hackathons are bagged by IIIT B students, ACM ICPC world finalists, 11 GSoC selections this year and a lot more.IIIT Bangalore's curriculum is much advanced and well versed and is frequently updated and upgraded every year according to the changes in the IT sector whereas PEC's syllabus has been almost the same since the last few years and not only that but course like Optics, Environmental science, Ethics and Engineering drawing are still covered which don't even have any relation with the CSE course applied for. But some might find PEC more appealing because it offers electives in Bioinformatics, Biometrics and Natural Language processing which aren't available in IIITB yet. But that is just an elective they offer. At the end of the day IIITB's curriculum wins the race.Oh, the location advantage: Not only that IIIT B is situated in Electronic City, Bangalore and is surrounded by IT companies so doing an internship is easier with more options to chose from but Bangalore is a very happening place for students to hangout. Other universities like PES, IISc., Christ University, Symbiosis, IIM, RV College etc. are nearby and a lot of events happen every now and then. You will have a lot more exposure.This pretty much sums up everything regarding the academics and all I could say is IIIT Bangalore is a better option than PEC University.

So, that is approximately one girl for every 5 guys. Now in these 18 girls, let us say 2–3 already have boyfriends and have no intention of getting a boyfriend here. So, that makes it 15 girls. Out of these 15 only 3 got boyfriends here, which means out of the 93 guys only 3 had the privilege to have a girlfriend. That is close to 3% . Some guys have girlfriends out of the college. Let us say there are 8 guys like this. So, this way approximately 11% have girlfriends. No wonder, everyone is waiting for the juniors to come and guys are hoping for a better gender ratio where as girls are hoping for a more or less same gender ratio (since that would mean more guys with very less number of girls :P ) Tejas Kotha , Varada Desikan P S , Vishesh Ruparelia , Sarthak Soni , Shivam Kumar Singh, Vibhav Agarwal , Satvik Ramaprasad, Maneesh Papa maybe you people might want to put this from a guy’s perspective :P If you want to join here, please be aware that you might have to spend these five years without a partner :( All the best!

Also thanks Tejas Kotha for your critical view of the college clubs. Let me give my input here. The situation isn’t like how Tejas Kotha described. Most clubs are at its infancy. Only around 3 years back the college had enough strength(no of students) to even start the coding club (Zense). That is because iMtech has been around for just 5 years now. But in that 3 years, that club has achieved so much. This year the have produced 10 GSOCers which is very high if u consider the number of students in the college. Out of the 10, 4 gsocers are from Zense. Naturally it took some time for other clubs to be formed. The other clubs technical and non-technical have been formed very recently (less than 2 years). I only participate in the technical clubs so I am gonna talk about that. The robotics club was just formed this year. There has been tremendous progress, each team did around couple of projects each. There has also been 2 dream projects which will be mentored by the Professors and funded well by the college. Yes there has been logistic issues and the project couldn’t be started full-fledged this year. However now all the required equipment has been bought and funds has been allotted, so you can expect progress next year. Apart from that we have the Competitive-Programming club headed by ACM-ICPC world finals. This club was also formed this year. We had sessions held by the finalists giving us problems, advice and tips. Now in the summer they are going to hold CP competitions. Next year the club will have more activity as the members are now trained. See the point I am trying to make is that any club or organisation needs time and people. In general a club typically takes 3 years to mature. We are just getting started! Only the IMT2016 batch (110 students) had enough students for such clubs to be founded. When I joined the college I took this in positive spirit and decided that I will help in the foundation of these clubs rather than lament the absence of them. The college is very supportive of the formation and functioning of these clubs. The campus size and population will nearly double the following year (2017–18). New academic block! New grounds (Basket ball, football, cricket, tennis lawn) ! new batch! So you can expect more activity in the cultural and sports area. So I wouldn’t be worried by the lack of extracurricular activities if I were you. Cheers!

I add to this the converse, CSE students would need to know the working of underlying hardware that they exploit(un)Fortunately these two branches are like two sides of a coin, you would treat them as wholesome rather than in partsThe main difference would be in the ‘core’ courses that you deal with during the course of study - a greater focus on algorithms, programming and big data for CSE, and a greater focus on devices, circuits, VLSI and embedded systems for ECESurveying learning resources, practical requirements in the two fields and past history of academicians, it has been fairly smooth to transition to CSE regardless of prior fields of studyLarge part of this can be attributed to the easier accessibility of resources in practicing coding, understanding algorithms and so on as opposed to building circuits (components are not exactly part of easily accessible resources :P )With reference to peer support, I would opine that one should be open to the idea of collaborating with multiple groups across diverse topics, it is not often that a peer group does exactly set of courses (out of interest :P)There is a strong base and support group regardless of the choice of branch. Quoting from Harry Potter - “Help will always be given to those who ask for it” (be it from peers or faculty) holds good at IIITB too!‘Difficulty’ should never be used as a reason for discouragement, and I can definitely vouch for ‘difficult’ courses in both branchesCoding is definitely an indispensable asset, but given that the context is CSE, this is just the tip of the iceberg. Analogously, ‘digital design’ is in no way a course that reflects the vastness of ECE :) - rather not use these subjects to suggest either of the two branchesIn conclusion, there is no real disadvantage of either branch. The end goals should be similar considering the aforementioned interdisciplinary nature of the fields, except that you approach the goal from different sides. I would strongly suggest doing a cursory survey of the core courses which would give you way more insight into choosing a branch than the umpteen answers we would present here :) You can then decide what you choose as a base and what skills you intend to ‘pick up along the way’. Hope the inconclusiveness of this answer actually helps you go the extra mile to do some surveying and make an informed choice that you can stand by. For a closing note, let me tilt the scales set by the previous answers - ‘I have seen many electronics specialists that whip up fancy, functional C code…. not often that I see an algorithms whiz conjure up a low noise amplifier :P’.

Some backgroud first, I hold an experience of 12+ years in the area of Development, management and analytics. Somehow I got the chance to attend one of the corporate programs related to AI in my current organisation. This fuelled some fire in me to pursue more on ML/AI algorithms. I started studying some books on Machine Learning and luckily, I got chance to work in some data science projects (not in pure Machine Learning space, but atleast it was good enough to give me a start). Though I carry a decent exposure to Python, I got some more hands on into Python ML frameworks like sklearn etc. But I was always feeling to take up some academic course to connect the missing dots. There began the never-ending search and it didn’t end for like 10 months. There are so many courses that I got more confused rather than being convinced. I registered for a few from online platforms like coursera, udemy etc. but failed badly to complete those. Not because of the platforms, but rather my own schedule, habit of procrastination and some lack of motivation. Ultimately, one of my ex-colleagues, who happens to have a like-mindedness in this area and had done a thorough research on many other courses, discussed about PG diploma in ML/AI. Though still not 100% sure, I registered for the course and now I am almost 5+ months into it and here are some observations and experiences that may help you make some judgment in chosing the right course: The course starts with a pretty crisp preparatory course on Python for Data Science, Linear Algebra, SQL etc.The IIIT-B faculty is pretty good and that is one of the strongest positives about this course. They create the right balance of depth and breadth in terms of coverage and I think they possess a good amount of knowledge.Upgrad Learning platform provides an immersive experience.Upgrad provides a good support that helps in clearing doubts by arranging doubt-clearing sessions, industry sessions and through discussion forums.There are stringent timelines, so you absolutely need to keep up with the timelines. If you can’t afford 12-15 hrs per week, its going to be difficult.There are graded assessments after every session, so those test basic understanding of a particular algo or a topic.There are individual assignments and group case studies which help having a hands-on.A student mentor will be there to address academic and administrative concerns.Overall its a pretty good course and I fee it is rightly balanced. My only concern was that even though IIIT-B/upgrad expect a benchmark of 10 hours of commitment per week from students, that may not be sufficient for many. It will exceed even 15 hrs sometimes, but ultimately it depends on individuals and the depth they want cover. Overall, a positive feeling so far.

But as i moved forward, my learning graph grew exponentially. The course is still going on and i no more feel that insecurity of the choice i made. Laying down, some of the points which made this programme extraordinary. Course started with a preparatory material on Python dedicated for Data Science. It covered almost all the concepts right from the beginner to advanced level. Especially the knowledge of libraries like numpy, Pandas and various other charting libraries. I was new to python, but after couple of months, i feel comfortable in it. The preparatory material also involved basic, intermediate and advanced level mathematics required for ML understandings. I really appreciate the learning platform which UpGrad provided. It is meant to design for learning online with Discussions forum, connecting to Peers, Faculties, clearing doubts etc. The platform provides the content of each week and the programme expects each individual to put atleast 10-12 hrs per weeek. Let it be submission of Assignments or completing the weekly module, the deadlines are sacrosanct. There are individual assignments and group case studies, quaterly exams conducted at every level. I am not sure about the placement or job related stuff, as my course is still going on. A small group of 10-15 students are formed and each group is assigned an individual Coach for Technicalities and a Group Mentor for any other sought of management. So, if you guys are really interested in learning Data Science, ML and AI, right from the scratch or even if you already have some background, i would recommend UpGrad.

With 18+ years of experience in different fields, but mostly IT, Data Science was the obvious coice for me, as I have been working in Analytics for a long time, and Data Science triggered my future career dream. With that, I was looking for a diploma that would suit my professional life (parttime and online) and exploring different courses I came to know about Upgrad and IIIT Bangalore course. As it is providing a PG diploma it attracted the most, as I already did several courses before (Microsoft Data Science, coursera, Edx etc. I signed up in December 2017 and enrolled the course in March 2018 cohort. Overall it has been a very good experience, with of course some pro's and con's as well, which is normal in any e-learning environment. Content: The course provides a structured plan during the 11 month time period. Starting with basic elements, like SQL, Data Analysis and programming in R (and future cohorts in Python as well) and Excel (my favorite :-) ) Then it goes into more detailed courses for statistics and EDA, then Predictive Analysis (ML, modeling) and closing up with Big Data modules. last part is a final project, which I still have to start. Overall, the content is very helpful. Of course some courses are a bit more difficult to follow then others, and especially some of the optional courses (like Neural Networks) are a bit more complicated. But in general it is easy to follow and the individual and group assignments do put you to a test. Every module contains video and theory, supported by additional resouces (articles, etc.). The course has graded questions, which are doable if you keep up with the theory. The individual assingments are a good test of your capabilities and working for the group assingments has taught me a great deal, as you azre working with fellow students on a case. Commitment: The course says it takes about 10 hours per week to follow the course contents. My personal feeling is that 10 hours is enough to complete the basic course items, but like me, learning additional things, or exploring more details and background, might take up more time. Besides that, Upgrad provides a lot of additional things, challenges, kaggle competitions, etc. which might take up more of your time. But all for the better as you learn and learn. Career Path: I have not enrolled for the career module Upgrad is providing. Though, they give good guidance in mentorship, building up your CV, etc. Comparison with other programs: I think the 11 month duration of the course, gives a fair amount of theory and practise, but as in any school system learning will only come by applying this in the real world. Looking back at other courses I have done, I was happy with the time constraints (deadline almost every week), which keeps you up to speed and focussed. This is missing when you do free courses online. I see other online courses as addition to my learnings (for me, statistics is one of them to explore in more depth for example). So overall, Upgrad is providing a very good platform, online materials and most of all, a network of people (~400+ people in one cohort). I made some good friends during the course, which will be helpful for the future for sure. Cost: Every thing in life comes for a price ;-). I think the 2 Lakh + cost for the course is justified, but might be on the higher side for some people. But, as I think it's an investment for the future, it defintely adds something to my career. Previous course where I paid for certificates have been not much cheaper than this course, plus the duration was much shorter (3 months). Having availability to content for 3 years and a network of like-minded people is something you cannot buy. Overall: I think the diploma course is very useful for a start in Data Science. As said, additional readings, learning and catching up with content that you are not familiar with, is a must. I love Data Science, so I started blogging about it, which I think would not have happened, without attending this course.

Although the course taught in DA-IICT isnt exactly CS, it is ICT. Don’t worry, they are quite similar. Each college has certain areas in which it excels. So I have made a comparison between the two colleges based on some commonly asked criteria : Faculty - The faculty assembled in IIIT- Bangalore is definitely one of the best in India. Professors who earned their PhDs from world renowned universities like MIT, Berkley, Purdue etc. guide the students throughout their course.Location - Bangalore being the Silicon Valley of India, it obviously is a huge advantage over Gandhinagar. The various seminars which we attended in Bangalore were simply amazing. From meeting Nobel Laureates(David Gross - Kappi with Kuriosity) to Quora legends(Balaji Vishvanathan - TEDx), we experienced it all. The absence of hackathons and tech-fests like GoogleDevFest and IOT Hackathons are a major setback for those being in Gandhinagar.Alumni - Both colleges have a really strong alumni base since both colleges started around the same year and have kept in touch with their former students.Coding Culture - In this criteria, DA-IICT, have had many GSoCers and ICPC finalists. IIIT-B had started the iMtech program in 2012 while DA-IICT is a mainstream Undergraduate Institute. This year IIIT-B has had 1 ICPC finalist as well as 13 GSoC selections.Extracurricular - The campus of DA-IICT is bigger compared to IIIT-B. DA-IICT has a famous annual fest-Synapse. IIIT-B has its sports-social open fest called Spandan. IIIT-B has all facilities required for sports enthusiasts, including volleyball, basketball(will be constructed by the time the 2017 batch comes in), football, table tennis and badminton(sort of a religion in IIIT-B).Internships and Placement - The first batch of iMtech will pass out in 2017. Although all of them have got internships during the placement period(placements for iMtech happen when they start along with their 9th Semester) most of them will convert into FTEs. The official statistics haven't been released by the college authorities till now, but the average salary offered is around 12-14 lac pa(as we got to know from seniors). Students in DA-IICT also get placement with students bagging jobs in Amazon, LinkedIn and various service companies.Please refer to the official placement stats on their website. IIIT-B generally do not allow service divisions of companies like TCS during placements. IIIT-B tries to promote developmental skills and prepares its student to be innovators and not mere servants. The highly respected and known faculty also provides the students opportunities for fully funded foreign research trips to MIT(USA), RMIT(Australia)etc.IIIT-B takes in students purely on merit. While 50% seats in each batch of DA-IICT is reserved for Gujarat students. So this is what I know about both the institutes. Finally it is your choice, but I would like to advise you to select your main criteria for taking admission and then deciding(not just for the above two). Cheers!

I had no prior coding knowledge (may be a bit of printf statements in C language and this is it :D) neither I had any coding background from my past B.Tech course (it was in Electronics and Comm.). My course journey was quite smooth, thanks to the M.Tech course curriculum and awesome faculties that bring every student on the same page (despite their background) during the course of 1st Semester and after the 1st semester, it all depends on your interest, how you wanna move further (I chose Data Science but there are more options available as well so one can go depending upon his/her interest). Faculties are very nice. In fact, they are one of the best and trust me, if you have interest in some area, you can really excel in it by the help of decent faculties (of course, your hard work and concentration matters). About the placements, your marks don’t really matter as long as you have certain lower cut off (in some cases only). Almost every student gets a decent package with and amazing list of companies visiting the campus every year. I was also one of those lucky ones to get into one of such top MNCs but as I said, every guy gets decent opportunity and package at the end of the course. It was just a short experience of mine. I don’t want to get into too much of details but all and all, I am pretty satisfied with my choice and the guidance that I got in IIIT-B family. From a non-coding background to a decent coding platform to the introduction to this whole new big data domain and the opportunities, I really enjoyed the journey through out and this is the case with most of students that I know in IIIT-B. Now coming back to your question, If you are looking for B.tech courses, you have no choice but to drop IIIT-B from your list. Other than that, if you wanna compare, you probably should compare IIIT-B with top - 3 NITs (for M.Tech in CS/IT courses) only. You can go with other factors such as location and all to decide your choice though I would still be in favor of IIIT-B due to its location and my experience (in M.Tech course) here..:p but for lower NITs, IIIT-B is always the choice.

The placement figures are officially declared when the current academic session is over.Yes, it’s true that some students wait for converting their internship offers into full time. I know what’s creating doubt in your mind if you are only concerned about the placements(that means getting a full time offer).It’s quite simple actually if you think about it. If you get internship + Full time offer from a company, then you may think you are done with the placements. But what will happen, if you don’t like the work during the internship itself? Are you still gonna want to work in the same company? You would surely try for other options.Now understand this from the company perspective → Most of the companies are not sure whether the students are going to be proper fit for their teams. During the first 6 months, you don’t add any value[you are in the learning phase], instead your learning is taken care at company’s expense.If they like you they will be happy to offer full time as well. It’s a win-win situation for both.However, there are some companies that do make it very clear during the presentation itself that they are looking only for intern and will not provide full time offers. You can opt out from such companies during placement season.Abhinav Shrivastava's post in My thoughtsI can help out with IIITB only:Abhinav Shrivastava's post in My thoughtsAnother similar question: What would be a comparison between CSE at IIIT Delhi and IIIT Bangalore?Opportunities present for M.Tech IT in IIIT Bangalore:Abhinav Shrivastava's post in My thoughtsCompetition is not iM.Techs, it’s with yourself → iM.Techs don’t affect our placements.They are really talented but you already know from the beginning that when bigger companies visit our campus they are going to put you through a coding round first.

If you cannot spend that much time, and want to do a part time course while working, like Advanced Program in Data Sciences in IIM C which gives you the below structure. The duration of the programme is one year (ISB’s course is 15 months). Each candidate has to go through eleven courses (ISB: 15 Courses + Capstone Project) . The sessions will be delivered through D2D platform twice a week for three hours each. (Same in ISB too) Campus Component: This is a crucial component covering 10 days in total (2.5 days, 4 days and 3.5 days respectively). It is compulsory for all participants. ISB’s Campus classes will be 5 days in every alternate month. So more physical interaction with Professors. Total No. of Contact hours: 275 hours (Approximately) (ISB has way more) IIIT B’s Course minus capstone project is similar to IIMC’s Advanced Program The 11-month online PG Diploma program, co-developed by IIIT Bangalore and UpGrad, covers the depth and breadth of the subject in the form of interactive lectures, live sessions and a 3-month capstone project mentored by industry professionals. In my opinion, Capstone Project is very important for you to get hands on experience after you slog through the theory. Not going to talk about Fees, I dont know your financial status. You need decent amount of time to get familiar with things, so you need make time for it. Be it, IIMC or ISB or IIITB. Many people who has done the courses after putting in a lot of money say that ROI is not as good as they expected. But, its good for me. So, It entirely depends on what you expect your life to be after the course that determines your “ROI Satisfaction”. Outright, I would say ISB’s course is good among part time courses beccause it has all the things that are required. Brand, Faculty, Industry Connect, Curriculum, Alumini. Not that the other two don’t. This has more time for all the subjects and capstone projects too. Only disadvantage that people point out is that the fee is too high. Agreed and Disagreed, you can turn the tables after the course (very debatable statement). I hope I didnt confuse you more. You can always contact me on FB if you want to ask more questions.( search with my name) ",0.1842666666666667,Positive,3.3685333333333336,0.7122641509433962,1,4.368533333333334,3.3685333333333336

In fact, many students have already been extended full time offers during the campus placements. Regarding the statistics, I cannot reveal the numbers on a public platform. However, top tech giants and funded start-ups have heavily recruited from the campus, and some of the companies especially wanted to hire the iMtech students. Given the fact some students have also been extended overseas internship and full time offers as freshers, speaks volumes of the talent at IIIT-B. Long story cut short: The placement season has been great so far. The placements have been comparable to that of top institutes of India like the IITs and NITs . I personally feel if you look at the average figures of placements in branches (other than Computer Science(CS)) in top IITs/NITs, the placement figures of IIIT-B would be significantly higher.

So in my opinion, this first batch might struggle in the beginning due to lack of experience but with all the quality that they have, they will rock the placement season!

The digital age needs computer scientists Like it or not you're living in it – this is the Digital Age. Computer programmes have all but infiltrated every aspect of our lives. Computer scientists theorise, design, develop, and apply the software and hardware for the programmes we use day in day out – sounds pretty important to us. 2. Computer science students have excellent graduate prospects Check out our Computer Science subject table, look down the Graduate Prospects column and you'll notice that computer science students stand a pretty good chance of being professionally employed or in further study within 6 months of leaving uni. And that chance is strengthened if you go to one of the UK's best unis for the subject – the top 10 average aGraduate Prospects score of 93.6%. 3. Computer scientists earn big bucks Computer scientists are in demand and their salaries reflects this. Recent graduates in professional roles earn on average £23,144 a year. Compared to other subjects that's fairly substantial – just take a look at 'What do Graduates Earn?. According to Prospects.ac.uk, systems developers in senior management roles earn between £45,000 and £70,000 a year. 4. Computer scientists are needed in every type of industry Every industry uses computers so naturally computer scientists can work in any. Problems in science, engineering, health care, and so many other areas can be solved by computers. It's up to the computer scientist to figure out how, and design the software to apply the solution. Read our Computer Science Careers Guide.5. Internationally Diverse Cohort Computer science departments at typically benefit from having one of the more culturally diverse cohorts at their respective unis. According to HESA data nearly 9,000 computer science students come from overseas. A diverse cohort means you'll be exposed to different cultures and potentially finish uni with an international network of contacts to utilise later in life. More info on What do International Students Study?.6. Year abroad opportunities Computers have gone global, and it would be silly for Computer Science education providers to not reflect this fact. Check the opportunities for overseas study on the courses that interest you. A year abroad will provide you with a deeper understanding of how computers are used around the world, allowing you to experience other cultures, and gain some language skills in the process. Here's a list of Computer Science degrees with a year abroad. Click on courses for more details including contact details and entry requirements..

Such exposure is hard to find. Pros: Peer group here is much better than NITs (Except top 3–4) since there is no reservation Placements speak for themselves, with the first batch having an Median package of 14.7 LPA and the second batch having 17 LPA. Faculty is probably the best part of the institute. Very much approachable and if you have been to coaching institutes, where they would clear each and every doubt of yours, that’s exactly how they are like. Much different than what my friends tell me about their professors at IITs and NITs. Internships: Surrounded by major firms and IT Giants in the heart of electronic city of Bangalore, Getting interns becomes very easy (The hard part is the traffic xD ) Infrastructure and maintenance: If you have any problem as small as your unclean room, there are facilities/helpers to handle that for you. Dirty clothes? Laundry Anna will take you clothes from your hostel and return it to you the alternate day. People are there to make your life easier and help you focus on your acads. Cons: Sports and fests: Sports and fests are not given the respect they deserve since people are more interested in hackathons and other coding competitions.This might come under a pro that if you’re not into sports a lot, and coding intensive, this is the place for you. It’s not that we don’t have any sports facilities, but here while (Alive):Importance (Coding>Sports) See my answer below for sports facilitiesGaurav Das' answer to What is the nature of sports in IIIT-B? Small campus: Might be a deal breaker for many, but we have a small campus of 10 Acres which houses 600–800 students in total. Yes, the size seems small, but it is not the case when you take in account the population of the institute. 5 year V/s 4 year : Long lasting debate, but we can’t do anything about it, that’s how the course is, with our last year being an internship or a Thesis, I don’t see how it makes much of a difference. Still this bugs many people about their willingness to specialize too quickly, hence I added it as a con. Fees: It might be expensive for certain students, as the total fee comes out as 20+ Lakhs, for that we have a provision of Merit based and Merit Cum need based scholarships, but for that a student needs to have a stellar performance. Apart from all the Pros and Cons, Another point I’d Like to add is: Reputation: Based on what I have seen, with just two of our Dual Degree (Btech+Mtech) batches passed out with great achievements in all arenas like Post Docs and Placements, we still need some time to convert all of this into a legacy.

I can say it is a very good, neatly designed course with ample opportunities for internships, coding competitions etc., and the placements record has been impeccable. The college has very good curriculum for CSE, and there is a very healthy environment in the college, be it studies, coding or sports, which also proves important for a long stay in the campus. You can visit the college website and search the annual reports available for past few years.

Since then, a few things have changed and I have updated the answer (marked with “UPDATE”) to reflect the same. That is a really difficult comparison to make. I will answer the question based on the parameters that you have asked for: Education Quality (Curriculum)InfrastructurePackagesAs well as add some of my own: FacultyPeersIndustry Connections and InternshipsCoding/Learning CultureI'll be comparing IIIT A's 4 year BTech in CS Programme with IIIT-B's 5 year iMTech in IT Programme. So here goes: A = 0, B = 01. Education Quality (Curriculum): The course structure of both the programmes are quite similar with nearly the same subjects in each semester. In both the cases, students get hands on with core computer science subject right from the beginning of the course, unlike other colleges where the first year is common across all the branches. Both the courses are quite relevant with respect to current industry standards and have a research edge as well. A = 1, B = 1 2. Infrastructure: The Allahabad campus is massive (so I have heard), compared to that Bangalore is miniscule(less than 10 acres). That being said, Bangalore does have all the requisites, proper lab facilities and sports facilities though they can be improved. UPDATE: IIIT-B now has a second Academic building which although increases the academic infrastructure, the campus itself remains of the same size and very small. A = 2, B = 1 3. Packages: The iMTech Programme at IIIT-B started in 2012 and the first batch is just about to enter their 4th year. So, the kind of placements and packages they get still has some time to be known. The BTech Programme at IIIT-A on the other hand has been there for quite a long time (>15 years) and the placements and packages students get are just shy of what they give out at IIIT Hyderabad and the IITs.The MTechs at IIIT-B however get quite well placed, in companies including IBM, Microsoft, Google, Intel, Amazon, Flipkart and others. UPDATE: The first batch of the iMTech Programme at IIIT-B is sat for placements over the 2016–2017 session and the kinds of placements and packages that they got is on equal footing with its MTech Programme as well as comparable to old IITs and IIIT-H. A = 3, B = 2 4. Faculty: This is where Bangalore really shines. With almost all the professors being Ph.Ds, professors at IIIT-B are Nationally and in several cases, Internationally known experts in their fields. Nearly every professor here is an industry veteran with both research and actual work experience under their belt. Allahabad has excellent professors but this is where Bangalore does own Allahabad. A = 3, B = 3 5. Peers: IIIT-Bangalore recognises no reservations of any kind. Also from 2015, admissions to the iMTech programme are based solely on JEE score. This ensures there is no dilution in the quality of the students who join the institute. Also the interaction that takes place between iMTech students and the MTech students is much more than what happens in most colleges, including IIIT-A. Thus, the peer groups, seniors and juniors you'd interact would be of superior quality. A = 3, B = 4 6. Industry Connections and Internships: Being situated in the heart of India's Silicon Valley, Electronic City, Bangalore, IIIT-B enjoys an connection to the software and electronics industry, IIIT-A can hardly claim to match. Several professors have ties with people in key positions in industry and academia. This makes it easier for students to land internships even in their first/second year be it with startups or bigwigs like IBM. A = 3, B = 5 7. Coding/Learning Culture: The Coding culture at IIIT-Allahabad is excellent, one of India's best, all thanks to its wonderful students who understood the need for a proper competitive coding culture (All Hail Humblefool). Bangalore still needs to work on this, although there are quite a few gems in coding at the institute (Hail VastoLorde95). However being in the close vicinity of the Tech industry, IIIT-B students enjoy the oppertunity to take part in the plethora of hackathons that take place in the city on a regular basis. Hackathons are a way of not just learning but showing off your application skills to those who can help you do something useful with those skills. For IIIT-A students, this is a drawback. UPDATE: A team from IIIT-B competed at the ACM-ICPC (led by our VastoLorde95) and competitive coding is fast picking pace in the institute. Also in the Google Summer of Code 2017, number of student selections from IIIT-B’s iMTech Programme stands at 9 (among 360 undergrads) compared to 12 (among 1050 undergrads) of IIIT-A. IIIT-B’s coding culture is fast catching up to IIIT-A’s. A = 4, B = 6 Following suggestions from Vikas Yadav and Suprgya Bhushan, adding a few more points. 8. Campus Life: IIIT-A has a better campus life to offer to its students in terms of fests and clubs. This kind of a culture is still to catch up in IIIT-B. We have only a sports fest, Spandan held in March every year. UPDATE: We now also have an Annual Cultural fest - Infin8 held in January every year. A = 5, B = 6 9. Startup Culture: IIIT-B with its own proven Startup Incubator has better affinity for a startups. See 50 Amazing Startup Incubators and Accelerators in India which has clearly mentioned IIITB Innovation Center. IIIT-A is yet to start a Startup Incubation programme. Having a homegrown incubators allows infusion of ideas and helps students build their ideas into full fledged businesses. A = 5, B = 7 Well that's my way of looking at it. The choice is yours.

IIIT Bangalore is much better than our college, There, I said it. I regret coming to this place, and this answer is the reason why. I had the same options of choosing between these two (JEE Main AIR under 7000), I chose IIITA because of the same ignorance that Indians have about a “Government College” (For those of you who don’t know, IIIT Bangalore is Part Government and Part Private (PPP model) Google it to understand better, which only means that the Fee is a bit higher) Let me tell you one thing that I have to face every day, A guy who just cleared JEE last year is studying with ME. That hurts! I studied day and night to get here and this guy just got in because of reservations ? IIIT Bangalore beats IIIT Allahabad’s ass in this area. EVERYONE IS EQUAL there,without any reservations Check out the faculty of IIIT Bangalore. Much better than IIIT Allahabad. Want to compare placements? IIIT Bangalore’s Dual Degree students’ FIRST BATCH had a Median package of 14.7 LPA and the next batch has 17 LPA. Our current (14th batch) has that kind of placements. think about IIITB when they would be graduating their 14th batch. Faculty, Placements, Location, smarter people, everything favours IIIT B, why IIITA then? Just because It has lesser fee? That’s just dumb. You can recover the fee amount in less than 2 years, DON’T ever compromise on education. Plus: our director being the person he is, an arse, you can even search a video of his ignorance(now a different person) some years back when a guy committed suicide because of the administration and he put the blame back on him and cursing him all the way along, and a similar case happened in August 2018 as well, which shows how sh-t the administration is. Also, he is the person who discontinued my course. Also, He is the person who doesn’t like Mtechs Also, He is the person who doesn’t like ECE students and favours IT all along (Yeah, I am IT, and it doesn’t affect me, but think about the plight of my ECE friends) Also, He’s the person who F-ed up our syllabus and the coding culture is affected because of him. We’re in a ball rolling downhill in this current Director’s reign (Now you understand why I am anonymous, right? I don’t want him to kick me out of here, well, I would be leaving this place anytime soon) You don’t want to live this way. I have seen IIITB’s Director personally having coffee with his students and I’m like the F*** why? how? and the students told me, he likes to listen to people. THAT I WANT.

First things first, placements have NEVER been a problem at IIIT-B. In the 15 year history of the institute I guess there will only be a handful (no jokes here) of people who haven't gotten placed at the end of the course. There are multiple reasons for this (discussed below), but this has led to a reputation for the college as a college with 100% placements*. Speaking broadly, we have: 100% placements, every yearThe entire placement process is managed completely by the student placement committee, with almost no interference from the administrative side (except when requested for :P). So, the companies invited/visiting include a lot of student favorites. We try our best (and often succeed) to ensure a good fit between profiles being offered and the students' preferences.Companies that visit/have visited campus include <you-name-it-and-its-in-the-list>. A striking majority of these are product companies, with a tiny sliver of services companies.IIIT-B has a strong startup connect, both in terms of initiatives like an active E-Cell or an incubation centre for startups, as well as in terms of students/alumni bootstrapping startups, as well as the fact that we're in Bangalore, the heart of India's startup boom, so it's no surprises that we have quite a lot of startups hiring from campus as well.I've been in touch with campus placement coordinators across a couple of other premier campuses in India, and I'm proud to say we have a very comparable (infact better than quite a few premier colleges) company spread. Perhaps the one thing where we lack behind is in the financial services sector (the almost holy Quant profiles), which is a major contributor for the super inflated placement figures that come out from other colleges (That, along with dollar to rupee conversions are a ridiculous tactic many colleges use to get media attention. Read the amazing answer by Prof. Brijesh Kumar from IIT-Roorkee on the topic: User-9259019499028935931's answer to I am hearing the packages of 1.5 crores and 75 lakhs these days in IIT campus placements. Where are they made to do their work, in the US or India? ). However as an Engineering Masters Degree course, I'm not sure missing out on Financial Services companies is such a major loss after all.... Though I'm open to be proven wrong.I'm sure that people will ask things like average package etc. but these are details that we're not allowed to publicly release. I'll just say this though... You'll not be disappointed. ;)Reasons for our strong placement record: We have a  very strong alumni connect. It's amazing how many amazing seniors have been instrumental in bringing some of the biggest names in the industry to campus. The same alumni also undoubtedly look at IIIT-B as a major hiring location for startups they found.Besides, the entire course is structured to teach students not just theoretic but practical knowledge as well. The industry connect of IIIT-B was one of the founding mantras of the college, and we've stayed true to it after all these years. Lots of industry collaborations keep happening across different courses.The 6 month internship program. The final semester of the Masters programme is an option between a thesis, foreign exchange and an industry internship program. Quite a lot of people have offers made at the end of their internships. Instead of summer internships, which span 2-3 months, a 6 month internship is a win-win situation for both students as well as companies. My placement wishlist (I hope my juniors read this :P) : More research labs hiring from campus: We have some of the finest research labs hiring from campus, but definitely there's scope to improve. We need to reach out more to core research labs. Especially given the subjects that people study at IIIT-B, it's somewhat ironic that we don't have more research labs making the beeline to college.An ongoing startup connect: Especially over the last 2-3 years, IIIT-B has made an active attempt to reach out to the startup community for establishing ties with the college. This is undoubtedly where the future is, and I hope this connect goes on.A more formal alumni network: Like I've mentioned, the alumni network is very strong, but needs to be more streamlined. Active steps are being taken in this regard as well, and I hope this proves fruitfulGreater visibility: The college needs greater visibility. Period. The lack of a B.Tech programme has led to the college having a slightly less visibility in the industry. Programmes like the young iMTech programme are designed to get over these challenges. Building a reputation takes time, and for a young insti like ours, it's great that we've done so much in such a short time.* The placement reputation of IIIT-B works as a double edged sword though. There are students (albeit a minority) who join the college every year simply for the placement guarantee. Especially for a Masters Course, I personally don't really think this is a good sign. A Masters degree is not just about placements, especially when you are in a place like IIIT-B. The world-class faculty** always at your disposal, strong student involvement in practically every aspect of running the college, lots of ongoing research initiatives and a college that treats students like adults, not kids (seriously, some of the rules are ridiculously lenient), are all amazing things to waste over something as trivial as placements. IIIT-B is a place where you're not just learning about computers, you're learning about life. I know this sounds cheesily romantic, but ask any IIITB-ian and you'll see how true this is! :) ** Almost every answer about IIIT-B on Quora speaks about the ""world class faculty"" at IIIT-B. But I say this is very well deserved. We have some of the best faculty in the world who're from places like MIT, UPenn, CMU, CMI, EPFL etc. along with people with decades of industry experience, teaching subjects that they specialize in (Post doctorals are very common). This, combined with some of the best young minds in the country is a very potent combination. PS If you're a company representative and think you're up for hiring  from one of the finest pools of engineers we have in the country, do  reach out! :) Thanks for the A2A.

We also had theory questions where we had to do self-study about various concepts linked to the concepts discussed in the classes. We also had a project where we had to learn a framework by ourselves and apply the tools given to develop a Python application fulfilling a given program specification.

Refer the attachment: -  Now, the official data of NIRF for IIITB states that its median is 14.7 LPA for the 5 years integrated program which can't be fake.  For the case of MNIT, median is not clearly mentioned but the maximum and average packages are 40 and 14 lpa respectively for CSE.  The best part of IIIT B is that it is located in Bengaluru (an IT hub) and its minimum package is 6 LPA (as per their website) which is good enough but in MNIT the minimum package is not clearly mentioned. There might be packages close to 3 or 3.25 lpa offered by the mass recruiters (not sure as data is not clearly available). The best part of MNIT is that it is a central funded institute and hence the fee will be less and thus the Return on Investment is very much high. Fee of IIITB is approximately 780000 for the whole curriculum (excluding the hostel and mess charges) For MNIT it is 62500 per semester which comes out to be 250000 (excluding the hostel and mess charges) for whole curriculum. Suppose you are a very bright student (definitely you will be if you have the capability of getting CSE in MNIT that too from open category by competing with 1.4 to 1.5 million applicants pan India) and say you get a package of 11 lpa from MNIT… ROI is amazing… Suppose you get 12 lpa from IIIT B, ROI doesn't seems to be much interesting in comparison to MNIT. Don't go by the maximum package offered by the Institutes as only a few are capable to get those. From the above mentioned data the highest package of MNIT is 10 lakhs more than that of IIITB which is pretty good but only a few gems of the institute are blessed with it. Regarding respect and reputation, NITs are recognized and respected all over the country and also abroad. Hence you shouldn't worry about it. These are 50 years old premier institutes established by the Government of India and are recognized as an institute of national importance. They are also blessed with a very strong alumni base across the globe. Kindly note that I am not trying to defame IIITB as it is also a best in class Institute in its own league without any doubt. Conclusion : From my personal point of view, MNIT will be a better option from the ROI point of view, where the cost for a particular student is just 32% of the cost at IIITB (only tution fee is considered) … Considering that you have the capability to grab the above mentioned package from MNIT.

Learning methodology:- It hardly takes 6months of practice with weekly commitment of around 4-5hrs is enough to atleast cover all big data analytics concepts like Hadoop, hbase, hive, sqoop, spark, pig, mapreduce, scala, Cassandra, mongodb, storm, kafka written in java or python... But actual used tools in major companies are Hadoop(getting obsolete because of top class spark which is same as Hadoop only reliability, speed, one to two concepts differs), Apache Spark, Hive, Scala, Pig,Hdfs, Mapreduce. Note:- Tools differs but Concepts are majorly drawn from old ones. Easy to learn Any tools but Getting handson on concepts and realizing the actual working of the concepts plays a vital role in analytics domain. I would suggest you to first learn by doing, go for internships in a startups to gain lots of exposure in all aspects of technologies and real world issues and them jump onto big mncs with your wider skillsets.

If you get an admit into IIIT Hyderabad, just go, don’t think about any other college until it is an IIT or BITS(I would rank BITS Pilani campus and IIIT Hyderabad at almost the same level). Having said that, I am not sure if IIIT Hyderabad gives admission on basis of rank, it gives on the basis of your JEE score which is pretty low compared to the cutoffs for that college. If that is the case, then I think you don’t have an option between the two because then IIIT Bangalore is the only option that is viable(only if that takes admission on the basis of rank). I would also suggest a third option. DA-IICT. It is virtually unknown to a lot of people that after National University of Singapore, the highest number of recruitments done by Google are from DA-IICT if we consider only Asia. To be hired by Google, you need to clear the APAC which is again one of the toughest coding competitions and it is one of the colleges which is again amazing and since their closing ranks are always somewhere around 15,000 it shows the competition you’ll face there which will give you the very much needed exposure a computer science student requires.

I am currently in my pre final year pursuing Computer Science from Thapar University. I have had very good grades till now and I hope that continues further. Why did I say this? There will be no college where you'll find all perfect kind of faculty. There will be some extra ordinary, and a couple of those who either won't be interested in teaching or will not know how to teach. I am not saying they don't know stuff. They do, they just don't know the right way of communicating it. And then there are the ones who are good like not the ones who are extraordinary but maybe a step below but not too below. During my three years I have studied from all these teachers and I would like to say that in majority of the cases the ball will be in your court. It will be up to you how you make the most out of what you are taught and it will be the same case in each college. Then coming to coding. Well I don't think I am an excellent coder, partially because I felt shy in my early years to try and be a part of competitive programming clubs but well I had my concepts clear, I appeared for Microsoft, I cleared their coding rounds even though I didn't make it all the way. So again, up to you. You'll find the people who code, you'll find students cracking GSOC, students going to other colleges and winning Hackathons, students from other colleges coming to our college and competing in Hackathons. A significant number of students clear the ICPC each year and go to the nationals. So yeah, overall it depends on you. I will tell you one thing which was told to me by one of our alumni who happens to work in Microsoft headquarters at Redmond. He said, “Don't be a coder, be a developer. We can find people who can code but people who code it properly, who develop proper softwares, bug free and with full proof architecture are the ones we look for.” So, in Thapar, you'll find a mixed breed. There will be students who are completely into coding, there will be people like me who are interested in other areas(I am more interested in Computer Vision and Data Analytics so I code in R and Matlab which is pretty unconventional amongst undergrads) and there will also be people who don't know where to put a semi colon and I also believe that the college must put in extra effort to teach them. Then coming to the campus, it's quite big a campus, spread over 250 acres. We already have 10 hostels for undergrads and construction is ongoing for 3 more. The computer science department is amazing and everybody is helpful, right from a lecturer to the HOD. The hostels are pretty amazing compared to other colleges. You may want to search about Hostel J of Thapar University which will be open for you in 2nd year. Its one of the best in North India. The classes are made in an staircase manner so that seats at the end are elevated for the students to have clear view of the projector screens/blackboard whichever your teacher is using. Talking about the new branches certain students feel the heat when they say the number of students is increasing. Yes they are and I am one of them who oppose the increase in strength but I can't deny that few of the new branches are actually better than the conventional computer science take for example CML where you’ll gain an honours in Machine Learning and Data Analytics and mark my words, the world is shifting to data, there is no industry which is left untouched and the future is of data scientists. Now I would like to come to the societies part. I have been involved in a lot of societies right from participation to organisation. When I entered college, I was welcomed by the members of the Frosh Week society and the day you see them working you want to be a part of that society which I did become in my second year. I was a part of the Literary Society since the first semester, took part in lots of events and rising up the ranks I became Joint Secretary of the society last semester. I am also the current General Secretary of Creative Computing Society which is the biggest technical society on campus and yes we have made sure that students get the competitive programming experience hands on. I have taken part in various intra and Inter MUNs organised in our college which have been the most memorable part of my college life. There are more than 40 active societies/clubs/chapters working in campus and not a single week goes by when there isn’t a single week that goes by without an event taking place. The techno-cultural fest of the college is also very good and will take place from Oct 21–23 this year and apparently I held the position as the Marketing Head for last year’s festival. Overall, these will be the four years you'll cherish throughout your life. Students from Thapar have been selected in various IVY league colleges for higher studies and that speaks for the college itself.

I have seen many courses which either cover Machine Learning or directly skip to Deep Learning. I came to know about this course by one of my friends who was pursuing PGD in Data Science from IIIT-B and UpGrad. I immediately inquired UpGrad about the course and I've got the course content from the team instantly. I was thoroughly impressed with the content as it covers from Basic Mathematics, statistics till Deep Learning, Graphical Models which is something I have been looking for and it is just not a certificate program, you will earn a PG Diploma. However, what made me choose this course was different. I've attended many courses through MOOC but many a times I either drop from the course or complete with no solid outcome. But, when my friend explained me how the course works then i decided to pursue it and once i started the course i realized that what my friend explained about the course was exactly reflected. One thing for sure is : ONE HAS TO BE VERY SERIOUS ABOUT THIS COURSE. This is just not another MOOC course. It is a solid university course which demands your precious time albeit for your benefit. Below are the key points which made this course popular and unique. 1) It is year long course and at the same time very rigorous which itself says the depth and breadth of the course content. 2) Prerequisites like Mathematics, SQL and Python are well taught for more than a month even before the main course starts 3) Professors are extremely knowledgeable and often takes live sessions for any clarifications. 4) What works in favor of students to complete this Diploma is stringent timelines which followed very strictly. Modules are published on every Sunday and we need to complete it in a week. Failing to do so attract the penalty of marks. I think it motivates one to be alert and take the course seriously. 5) Checkpoint quizzes in between the module make sure that you understand the content well. Unless you answer the quiz, further section is not opened. 6) Assignments are frequent for every important topic and quality of the assignment is good. From the assignments, we really get to learn something about the real industry problems. 7) All the cohort students are connected through Discussion Forum which is a great platform to rectify one's academic related queries and is continuously monitored by the Teaching Assistants to maintain it relevant and clean. They also help us in clarifying academic queries. 8) Each student is assigned with a student mentor who is extremely helpful for any non-academic related queries or issues. 9) Frequent sessions by industry experts gives us opportunity to learn the how currently Machine Learning and AI is being applied for the industry problems and how we must be prepared for that. 10) Career guidance is provided by UpGrad and they do excellent work in arranging frequent base camps and career guidance sessions in the IIIT-B campus. One of the few complaints i have with the course is about the timelines. Being a working professional i sometimes get exhausted to meet the deadlines. But that’s how it works and over the time i got accustomed to it and feel may be this is the only way i can be on my toes. Other complaint is about the release of the modules. They won’t release the next module till Sunday of every week. This would be the hindrance for people who complete the module ahead of time and have to wait till the next week for the next module. Other than those, i am very happy with the way course is progressing so far and I highly recommend it.

I found the faculty to be highly qualified, experienced and knowledgeable in the subject on par with the best in the world and they explain you the complex concepts in a very simple way to start with and then give a mathematical treatment and abstractness. You are tested with simple to complex questions throughout the course and augmented with case studies and assignments. You will never not learn in this course provided you put in efforts from your side. For me, more than the degree or certificate itself, my foremost requirement was to learn the concepts with great clarity and develop the ability to use these in solving business problems. i felt i am successful in that with the help of the outstanding professors Secondly, it's not an yet another course where you are not tracked and supported, you are dumped some materials and forgotten. In this course, you are tracked week after week relentlessly upto the end of the course and you have stringent deadlines to me met through the course. You really have to be on your toes to complete your allocated activities within the stipulated deadlines. Though it may look like, they are very demanding and strict, this may be one of the reasons why the students of this course are very successful everywhere. From online questions, quizzes, assignments, case studies, exams and viva voce you are 100% tracked . It also goes without saying that if you are unable to allocate a considerable amount of time every week, you will find it difficult to manage or complete this course as its an extremely rigorous technical program. Thirdly, you are put into a pre-program training in python, statistics, mathematics and other basics before the actual program to ensure that you are well prepared to cope up with the program without much difficulty. The main content of the program is exhaustive and is of high quality and contains many advanced optional modules and links for more exhaustive learning. Fourthly , there is a discussion program monitored by a faculty and here you can discuss all your questions and you get all your doubts and queries clarified. Its a great forum and i have had some technical discussions in this forum. Fifthly, you have mentorship sessions, a dedicated friendly student counsellor who are all there to help you at all times, live doubt clarification sessions, assignment and case study sessions, placement assistance, Additional training sessions if required. If you are ready to put in the required efforts, i can tell you that you cannot go wrong with this course. ",0.2026,Positive,3.4052,0.10849056603773585,1,4.4052,3.4052

Since btech is out of question here, you can go with Mtech or MSIT. For a Mtech seat in IIIT-Hyd,you will have to write PGEE/GATE exam. You need to prepare hard to get a good score in the GATE exam inorder for you to be eligible for the Mtech course at IIIT-Hyd. Since it is all india exam, if you dont get enough score you have to wait for the next year. You will also need to clear the interview before getting a Mtech seat in iiit. the whole thing needs strong preparation and enough of your time. But if you are ok with that trade off. Then you should go for Mtech. Also, getting Mtech seat requires for you to be good at coding and other computer scinece stuff before even getting into the college. MSIT on the other hand does not require you to put your months of effort and time at stake. You just have to clear an entrance test which is easy when compared to GATE The basic motto of MSIT is to take any student(who cleared msit entrance test) and make him IT industry ready. So how do they do this? The program is structured in a way that it covers all technical domains involved in the IT industry. You will be trained on front end, backend, DB, android, web developing courses with the core focus being programming skills(Data structures and algorithms). The best thing about MSIT is you can complete these courses at your own pace, without the fear of getting left behind if you dont perform good enough in one exam. Ok now lets jump into the pros and cons. Pros: With MSIT you can land you a job, which for many of your friends would be dream job You are most likely to get placed in tech gaints in IT For every 10-15 students there is a programming coach who is more than happy to clear your doubts immediately. If you have any issues or not happy with the way things are going, then you can go to any of the principal mentors who will give a workaround for that concern of yours. You get to stay for 2 years in a community that is very very competitive and passionate. From a graduate student with no prior knowledge of programming you will find yourself solving algorithms and dp based programs within no time In the second year, you will have to opt for a specialization of your choice and do industry standard projects under the guidance of corressponding Principal mentors. Also, the program is always evolving, the whole staff strives to to make MSIT the best program there can be. And constantly takes input from the last year students. You will make good friends and who knows, you might also find the love of your life; if you havent already ;) Cons: Its only for two years. There is no research option in it. Few btech and mtech students look down on you as you are MSIT. Again, only a few though. Everybody else doesnt discriminate. Now some people would argue that MSIT has strict rules regarding attendance, lab timings and all that. But if you give it a thought, you will realise that this is needed because MSIT takes in candidates who know nothing about coding and makes them get into dream companies like Amazon, Adobe, Paytm, Amex, etc. after 1st year itself. This means all that transformation has to happen in one year and hence the slightly strict rules are justified. PS: If a candidate is already good at academics, mentors dont mind overlooking all these rules. You can see that the pros are way more than the cons. Therefore you will have made a great choice if you joined MSIT @ IIITH... Good luck!!! ",0.2318895833333334,Positive,3.463779166666667,0.0660377358490566,1,4.463779166666667,3.463779166666667

I had read the same question six months ago and felt in a dilemma as to whether or not I should pursue this course. But when I came here I realized I took a good decision to join this course. There have been so many changes went through academically. Before I go a little further I would like to share a Chinese proverb here ""Tell me and I'll forget; show me and I may remember; involve me and I'll understand."" You can really be learning something when getting your hands dirty on it. And MSIT makes the students do that Learning by Doing. I'm a chemical engineer first, but I've had a passion for computers. I felt so bad for myself when I took my first course and thought I couldn't handle the test, but I was wrong. Mentors and PCs here are very helpful with to the students. They will help you to understand the topic for all levels. Another important thing was the change in the exam pattern. Previously my seniors had written exams. But from our batch, we had one on one vivas. From these one on one assessments, I came to know myself where and how well I stand in a particular topic. And this is the interesting part. And for every viva, mentors will provide feedback. It helped me get myself updated. Softskills, I should stress this because of its importance in today's world. Think of it this way when can code a hundred to two hundred lines of code for an application and you can't explain what that application do. You are completely failed. Here at MSIT, you can learn how to code and at the same time, and also learn how to present yourself and be in the business world. This way, you are programmatic and competent in your brain. Alumni engage, this was a programme started this year. where I can meet alumni of MSIT. This was a good start and more helpful for my seniors and for me too. From them, we can gain information and ask a question about the existing IT industry and get ideas from it. I felt motivated to hear about their experiences, personally.  This is the first alumni engage that we had. Placements, it's IIITH and you'll get good placement companies and it's contingent on your talent and hard work again. But by bringing good companies MSIT makes it easier for you. To my understanding, more than half of my seniors are already put in good companies and packaged well. Campus Life, I've been here for six months now and I've always enjoyed it. You can walk through the entire campus, it's very quiet and greenery lined. And the campus night canteen that runs until 3 am. And I had so much fun sharing birthday parties with my friends over here. Sports, MSIT didn't have time for the games. But, for the first time, MSIT has conducted a cricket tournament recently. Interestingly, mentors and programming coaches were also part of this tournament. frankly, apart from the busy academic calendar, organizing this sort of tournaments was a great thing. It gives some relief.  and soon another tournament will start too.  I've enjoyed studying for six months of my MSIT journey, sometimes you get irritated about your assignments but there will always be someone to help you out. Apart from all negatives that you have read on quora this will help you to decided whether or not to join MSIT.

Basecamps are organized in major cities, which gives a good opportunity to meet the fellow peers and attend the learning sessions. 2. Program Structure The program is very well structured. It is designed keeping in mind the varied backgrounds the program peers come from. There are preparatory sessions for students to understand the concepts required to begin the course. This is useful for students from non-technical background to understand the basics of Programming, Database and Maths. Also, useful to revise the concepts for working professionals. The Program is divided in a systematic pattern with all modules following a structure. Broadly, topics from CRISP DM, Modeling, Visualization, Hypothesis Testing, Machine Learning, Predictive Analytics, Big Data are part of the program. A detailed structure can be downloaded from the UpGrad platform. Also, tools like R, TABLEAU and MySQL are used during the program. Then there are exams during the program, which also help confirm our understanding of the modules and need hard work. To further confirm our learnings, assignments and group case studies really help to relate and apply practical aspect of our understanding. The capstone project in BFSI/E-Commerce/Healthcare domain in the program is industry relevant and monitored and evaluated by industry professional. This will also help make us industry ready in the data science field. 3. Student Mentors Every student is assigned a student mentor, who helps keep tab on keeping you up the schedule and reminding of the deadlines. This helps to keep track and keep learning at the same pace as your peers. I really appreciate the effort put behind the course with constant support from mentors who really keep you motivated and very helpful to solve all your queries. Another way to look at this is that, it helps with good completion rates of the program modules. 4. Program Peers The course has a healthy mix of diversity with peers from so varied backgrounds and experience. This brings great domain knowledge learning from peers. It has also helped build a professional network of peers with all having the same learning path and data science aspirations. The Group Case Studies are part of the course and are very helpful from two aspects, it gives a very thorough understanding of the practical implementation of the concepts and i really like that being part of a group all of the team member approach the problem differently because of varied backgrounds and domain knowledge. Since, everyone has a different way of solving the problem this healthy mix of ideas leads to brilliant solutions and more learning for the team. Discussion platform is very helpful to get doubts cleared from program peers and technical mentors and also get to know the peers as well. 5. Career Support Career support is 8-9 months post completion of the 11 month course. It is currently, happening for previous batches so, we do get to know of internship options and experienced positions fro peers who are already in the same field. For my batch, we have had a resume building activity and a basic introduction to the data science field call with industry mentors. Since, we are yet to reach the program completion so, will update on this later as and when it happens. 6. Program Fees: The program fee may seem on the higher side to some of the aspirants but i feel with the course content and the fact that we also get a PG diploma in Data Science from IIIT-B, makes it worth the cost. Additionally, its a great boost to your resume when you want to transition to this field with a strong knowledge base. My final thoughts are that one needs to be determined and put the effort to learn to excel in this field. The program is demanding and should be taken up if one can manage time well to meet the course deadlines. But, a dedicated regimen for studying the program and keep learning is the key to be successful and pass the program. This program will help build a strong foundation for successful transition to data science. Additionally, participating in hackathons and Kaggle competitions to solve real world problems will definitely give you an edge and land a job if one is willing to work hard. Hope this was helpful.

I get to code in R and Python (IIITB teaches in R, at-least this course). 3. Confidence Boost - when you hit and try at multiple competitions and fail and fail till you pass, it literally gives you the confidence to excel in this domain It is a very very rigorous course, if and only if you can spend 10 hours in a week, enroll in. Teachers are excellent and videos are very detailed. There are exercises, but all is waste if you do not practice (Watching Videos will not help in growing your knowledge area, practicing will ) A part of me likes to think that because of Deadlines which is mostly on every Sunday , I am a lot more arranged now, I plan my professional work accordingly so that I am able to take out at-least 8–10 hours in a week. (Please Note : The video session will only be of 6–7 hours, I am adding at-least 3 hours of you practicing what you learn) Career wise, They do offer placement support (Not guarantee) based upon multiple parameters, (Pl. note, Companies will have high expectations, as you will be a PG Diploma holder from IIIT B, for the same reason , you will ask for higher salaries, so its mutual, but again based upon your effort) My Suggestion: Do not Focus on Placements, It never helps, neither in college, nor in such courses, they have a very excellently designed Module as well as curriculum , for 11 months, devote yourself to the course. you will definitely see results in your current work life.

Also, this course may not be for you if you’re already good at Data Science or if you have a very high package (say above 15 lakhs as I see mentioned in one of the answers) and want a career boost in terms of salary. That being said, I believe you’re wondering if the program is useful or better than other programs in any and all of these aspects: LearningCareer GrowthCredentials.Return on investmentI’m currently enrolled in the program and so, have the advantage of more visibility and understanding of your predicament than most. Let me help assuage some of your doubts. First of all, I would like to say that this is a PG Diploma course and being so, it shouldn’t be compared with Full time PG courses in the same field. If you are considering taking up a full time PG course, please do so at your discretion. However, as their fee structure, teaching methodology and placement capabilities are vastly different from this or any online course, the comparison between the two would be unfair to a large extent. There are however, other PG Diploma (or similar) courses in the market, the most notable ones being those offered by INFOSE and BITS and we can compare the most important aspects of UpGrad/IIITB’s course that separate it from the other offerings in the same field: Learning: The course structure of IITB’s Data analytics program is extremely exhaustive and covers most of the topics that are required in the Data Science/Data analytics field. In fact, it may be a little more comprehensive than the Data Analytics courses covered in Queens, Schulich and Rochester universities. However, this is subjective, you can refer to the said courses online and make an assessment yourself.The vastness of the course does imbube fears of shallow teaching, however, I’ve seen that the Professors and Industry experts have endeavoured to explain simple topics in great detail and simplify the harder ones. In addition to that, additional materials have been provided for most of the topics. Apart from this, I can personally vouch for the availability and initiative shown by the Student mentors of the Program. I have requested for more material in order to gain a more in depth understanding of Data Science as I have been provided their full support. The program also hosts multiple Boot camps, knowledge sharing coding competitions/forums that encourage peer to peer learning. That said, I wouldn’t say that attending the course and confining oneself to the course material would result in an SME level of knowledge in Data Science. That would require extra effort from the individual and also a practice of going above and beyond what the course offers. However, I am of the view that this is common with most courses and so, doesn’t speak poorly of the course itself. Career Growth: I will defer from answering this question right now as I’m yet to finish the course and avail the said benefit. However, I am confident that it should make my career prospects better and certainly not worse from when I started the program.Credentials: The course provides a certificate from IIIT Bangalore (upon successful completion of course) which makes it as authentic as any other Degree from this University. I would say that as a central university that is at par with IITs and NIT in terms of staff appointment and research funding, an authentic degree from IIITB would be as good as any in the market. For more information on University rankings you can check the NIRF site that lists IIITB at 56.The other aspect of the degree is of it being an Online course and the stigma that comes attached to it. I agree that it may still be there, however, in the professional field, it wouldn’t matter much as most recruiters would be looking for a candidate with adequate knowledge and an authentic degree from a reputable university. If however, you have any future plans that require a full time degree, you should pursue along that path and not veer towards a part time course. Return on investment: Now this is a little difficult to comment on as the success of ROI may differ among individuals. That said, let us try to review this objectively. The course costs INR 2 Lakh and a relatively ROI would entail an INR 2 Lakh (or preferrably, more) return from a Data Science/Analytics related job post the course or due to a Data Science/Analytics related aspect of your current job/any other career that you wish to pursue.In this light, the ROI would be extremely high as most new Jobs will (to my knowledge and sincere hopes for all those reading this) pay you significantly more than 2 Lakhs. Also advancements in your current job or any other job that are directly or indirectly related to what you’ve learnt in the course; though may not be in the valuation of 2 Lakhs, will of course have an incremental effect in the future. There’s another aspect of this, that is comparison. Now, most of the other PG Diploma courses in Data Analytics are around the same range and so fees may not be the right way to look at them (for that, refer to the first point - Learning). It however, is significantly cheaper than full time Data Analytics PG courses. This makes the course ideal for any professionals that either aren’t in the position to invest a large amount in their higher education or can’t make it to full time classes. Hope my answer has been helpful. If you have any follow up questions, please feel free to post them on the thread or mail me directly at shaibalnandymazumdar@gmail.com.

Further, you have Teaching assistants, Personal Student mentors and the most important discussion forum where you can learn from your batch-mates. So, learning is unending. It all depends on you. Further, UPGRAD arrange Webinars on each topic, again to clarify doubts or make you learn in further details. You are always motivated to put efforts.Graded questions, exercises, practice questions, lengthy modules, tests, assignments, deadlines can make you feel that you are back to college. But at the end of your efforts, UPGRAD makes effort too to acknowledge that with goodies and treats. Base camps are also arranged in cities for meet-ups. In short, the experience of learning with Upgrad is awesome and The certificate from IIIT-B can make an enormous impact in your career. The batch consists of people already belonging to data science field as well as freshers. The assignments give you feel of the industry. Many online events are also notified by Upgrad. They assist for Kaggle, Github, Linkedin also. More to this, please note that they provide placement assistance also. Step by step, they take care of each student with counselling, provide assistance to select field and prepare resume. The best part is, you can get new friends. The experience of being together with all other data science enthusiast, discussing about different topics throughout the day among themselves is itself a great way to learn.

The platform is flawless has everything it should have and I really couldn’t think of what should I ask these people to include. I haven’t used the app though!Discussion Forum: This is one of the most crucial part of a learning platform for every learner and one wants to have his/her doubt cleared in the very next minute it comes up. So, if you are an enthusiast learner and you come with basic doubt at 3AM, you can simply google your doubts and get it sorted. But if you go through assignments and case studies, you’ll face many problems that can be understood only by the learners in the platform. Now you post your doubts on the discussion platform and different learners try to answer your doubts because they get paid (credit scores that are added on your final GPA). Their answers are verified by TAs which makes sure that yes you can rely on this answer. The drawback here is you don’t get your doubt solved in seconds. You may have to wait for as long as some hours if you get stuck at 3–5AM. But again there is WhatsApp group where you can get your doubts resolved instantly. You have your 25% of investment that is worth now.Contents: So this is almost everything we have to rely on. We get to learn from IIIT professors and top industry experts. I’d like to mention one of the industry expert S.Anand, CEO of Gramener. If you go through his linkedin profile, you’ll be like okay he has achieved a lot but how is he while delivering concepts to the learners? Trust me! The way he makes you understand concepts is mind boggling, You’ll be like What an investment!! Every concept he explains is justified with an industrial example he has already worked on. He shows the contents from his own firm to make you feel the topic. As they are taking good amount of fees, they have made sure to filter the instructors absolutely well. (45% of the investment is justified)Assignments and Case Studies: These have 45% weightage in your total GPA. When I first enrolled this course I felt like assignments must be like typical college assignments that you have to submit just for grades. Here you get to apply all of your learnings in the assignments as after every module, you get an assignment to submit. You get to know what all you’ve grasped from the module and sharp it up with those assignments. Some of the assignments are industrial relevant and some are just to sharpen your skills. In the case study, you make a team and solve a huge problem together. You get confident about your learnings only after doing these. (70% is justified now)Exams: I had never given such a strict online exam ever before. You can’t even move from your place while giving exam, if you do you get warning from the proctors witnessing you from behind your webcam. I don’t wanna say anything about content of the exam, they are conspicuous.Live Sessions: You get live sessions almost every week. When you have gone through a module, you’ll have a live session arranged in the weekend to clarify your doubts and have an insight of the module with some additional tips and tricks. You also get live session to seek motivation and make your life better but I didn't find it worth.There are a lot of things like Kaggle, upGrad Hackathon and many more that you get to participate on to sharpen your skills. As I’m from non technical background, it took me to give more than enough efforts in the beginning to learn coding and get a good pace. To get good pace in coding, just the upGrad platform isn’t sufficient. You have add HackerRank or Leetcode in your daily practice to get good command in python. For the remaining 30%, I’m relying on the career support they offer because it’s eventually the only thing you are gonna enrol this course for. I’ll keep updating as I go further in this course.

It starts from absolute beginner level to being comfortable in applying Advanced Analytical/Machine Learning techniques. Domain specialization is also provided. You can check for Program syllabus to get understanding on topics being covered, if you feel that you are already comfortable with statistics/Analytics topics mentioned in syllabus, then you need not pursue the course and go for some other higher specialization course. Brand / PG Diploma: IIITB has respected brand name and program being Post Graduate Diploma program is another advantage as opposed to some certification program. Time Commitments: Though it says 6-10 hours commitment per week, i have seen that it requires between 10-20 hours per week, on an average to get optimum learning. So, you should join this course only if you can plan and spend this much time. Placements: Placement assistance is provided by IIITB and Upgrad. There are few students who have already transitioned to better roles into Analytics. Few transitioned using placement assistance provided / few on their own. You should not expect that doing this program will guarantee desired Analytics job. If that is the case, then you might find yourself disappointed after course. Course will take you closer in skills to what is expected in Data Analytics roles but placement will depend on lot of factors like - Individual effort and skills/ Past Experience/ Preferences & Expectations in terms of new Job or Role / Effective Communication / Analytical Approach /Relevant Domain knowledge or experience etc. Comparison to other Free Online Courses: This PGDDA follows structured end to end analytics learning and rigour, along with domain specialization, placement assistance, engaged peer group which is difficult to find in Free Online Courses available. If you still don’t want to invest money just for learning Analytics, Feel free to try these free online courses. With so many free online courses available these days, you can learn Analytics without paying anything, although it might take more time when compared to a rigourous single end to end Analytics Course. Cost: -Cost of this PG Diploma is 2 lakhs as of now (some discount is also given if someone refers you before you apply for this program). For students who had transitioned to better Analytical Roles, this amount is not high when compared to value it has added to their career. Finally, You will have to decide for yourself as each individual has different aspirations and expectations.

At IIIT-D scholarship is given to all students. Internship opportunities: We have had Accenture Labs, Siemens research among research labs recruit students for internship.

But many of these courses are also taken by the same professors.  Do they have access to the same resources on campus? Yes. Practically a no-brainer here. Be it access to labs, clubs, coursework, projects etc. it's entirely a merit based system. Ask for it, and it shall be yours! :) Of course, besides the academic stuff also, the sports equipment, library, cafeteria, TV room etc are all available to the iMTechs just as much as the MTechs (and probably even used more by them :P ). Many of the committees/clubs on campus have an iMTechs involved, be it the Student Advisory Committee (SAC), the PlaceComm, the Music Club or just about any other club. Do they have access to the same companies for placements? Mostly Yes. The first iMTech batch will have their placements in ~6 months, and from what I've heard from the current PlaceComm (I'm a former PlaceComm member) is that it will be a shared placement pool. So unless there's a company which specifically asks for an MTech over an iMTech (the probability of this is small IMHO), or for previous industry experience (which some companies do ask for) then both MTechs and iMTechs will be vying for the same jobs. Do they have the same exposure to high quality research that MTech students have? I know many iMTech students who are part of the multiple labs on campus right from their second year itself. The fun bit is they're not just there as dummies, but actually contributing to cutting edge research. In fact, a Prof I spoke to recently was of the opinion that doing research with an iMtech student is more fruitful since they can work over multiple years on a project, unlike the MTech students who can almost never work for more than a semester or two on a project.  ==== Just to put some random facts: In the last 2 years, teams with the best rank in ACM ICPC from college have been iMTech students. Some of the best hackers on the Bangalore hackathon circuit are current iMTech students. Research papers co-authored by iMTech students have been published by almost every lab in IIIT-B over the last 3 years.

I suggest that you start participating in such talks and figure out for yourself. All the best.

(But I must say, there are a few classes that we all like to skip XP ) The course is pretty good. They have changed the course in 2015. We have core subjects in first year itself which makes the course very  efficient.  Campus is alive in the night! You can see people playing, watching movies, taking strolls, running around for last minute submissions, sometimes you can also see people just jumping around, club meeting etc. The campus is tiny, but it is in the heart of the electronic city. There are many food courts near by. Plus it is around 20 mins away from Kormangala( the happening place of Bangalore). Quite frankly, the mess food here is a way better than many other hostels. We have a vast menu. The food is not as good as home food. There will be times when you will just hate it, but nevertheless, the food is good enough. The main issue most students have with the food is that it is strictly vegetarian.( Eggs have been recently introduced on the menu).  Most importantly, there is absolutely no ragging (I'm a first year student, so experience speaking XD ) Seniors help you in every possible way. They make for pretty good friends too. It's not always about academics  with seniors. They are not one of those typical ""seniors"". You can argue with them, disagree, debate . just like you would with your batchmates (I can vouch for this.) There is very little senior-junior discrimination too.  As for the hostels, women's hostels are good. You get single rooms (Yes, in first year itself!). But trust me, that does not hinder prospective friendships. You can still have pajama parties etc. You have 24 * 7 supply of drinking water, solar heater. Washrooms are cleaned everyday and maintained well( I'm a cleanliness freak when it comes to washrooms) Rooms are cleaned everyday. Dustbins are emptied. You have external laundry service too.  Lastly, 7 months ago, I was in a dilemma. NIT vs IIIT. IIIT-A( IT) vs IIIT-B( CSE ). Drop vs just being done with it. Local college + repeat vs NIT. Local college + MBA vs practically everything.  I listed out the pros and cons of every single option.  Some pros and cons are: 1) Relatively a New Course: The iMtech course just began in 2012, and the first batch will pass out in 2017. This is one reason you might want to consider other options. 2) Not a large campus:The campus of IIIT Bangalore perhaps might be one of the smallest campuses among all engineering colleges in India. But  the infrastructure is just amazing and professional! 3) The beginning culture: The clubs in IIIT are in their infant stages, apart from the Music club, ISoC club and few others. As the new batches are coming in, new clubs are being formed. Though, i'm sure the clubs are getting better with time.  Also we have Spandan, an intracollege sports fest. Infin8, a cultural fest.. alumni meet among various other events. Most of these have just begun this year. And we will have a lot better fests in the future.  Pros: 1) The Faculty:Hands down, this is the strongest pro of the college. With professors from MIT, University of California Berkeley, Cornell University and Purdue University, this distinguishes the college from the rest. Not only this, the professors have strong industry links. Refer to this link for more details. 2)Alumni Network and Seniors: With well-placed Alumni in companies like Yahoo, Amazon, Intuit, Flipkart, Morgan Stanley, Cisco, Siemens etc. students need not have to worry about their placements. There are international exchanges where students come from best of the universities of the world for working with professors/startups. The presence of the MTech seniors is an asset for the undergrads, as they are always willing to help in projects, give their guidance and share their industry experience. Also, the PhD scholars and MS scholars have published some of the best research papers, which is an inspiration for the research enthusiasts. http://iiitb.ac.in/placements/placements-statistics  IIIT-B :: Placements ::  3) The Course: The iMtech course is in itself complete and unique. Suitable timings, courses accompanied by labs and projects, internship at the end of the third year, the choice to choose your stream are some of the highlights. 4) Potential for growth: You see the clubs being formed right in front of you. In fact, it is the students who take up initiatives, join and form new committees in college, organize fests and other events. The work which the junior iMtech batches have been doing deserves a special mention here. Other than this, iMtech students participate in various hackathons / coding competitions and the coding culture is picking up.

Faculty applicant are looking at how his/her career will take shape there. It means what kind of research support s/he will get, whether the institute has focus on excellence in both teaching and research (the relative weights will vary from applicant to applicant), who are likely to be his/her colleagues, particularly in the area of his/her own research, etc. Of course, every institute will argue that they will give all such support and that they are driven by excellence. The way one figures out the seriousness of these claims is either existing record (there are already faculty members who have joined and are doing well, as evident from their output), or trustworthy leadership. Initially, then the existing record is non-existent, it really is trustworthy leadership that attracts faculty. Now, the leaders themselves are faculty members, they already are known widely in the academic circles and hence have some reputation already. Of course, potential faculty members will also consider the reputation of the brand (and henec new IITs are able to attract quality faculty even when the Director is not such a great leader, since the potential faculty members knows that some decent level of quality will be maintained even without a visionary Director. The other things that a potential faculty member will look for are the living conditions - housing on campus or nearby, access to good schools for kids, access to hospitals for old parents, etc. So the hardest task of a new institute with a visionary leader is to attract the first few faculty members of good quality. Once that happens, the rest will follow. (Not so easy as it sounds, but things do become progressively easier.) On the other hand, surveys are primarily based on perception. And perceptions have a way to perpetuate themselves. If a college is known to be good in the minds of students and parents, that will attract higher ranked students. The HR managers of most companies can not identify quality when they see it. So they look at closing rank as a proxy for that quality. Now since more companies go there, they are likely to get more jobs, and potential students and parents will take placement information as proxy for quality. And this cycle continues. Surveys give a huge weight to perceptions directly, and some weight to things like placements (which is again a proxy for perception).  In short, you can not expect millions of people to understand quality, or evaluate quality. They will take decisions based on perceptions or simple parameters. But a potential faculty member can more easily understand quality since s/he is in the same industry, same game. And hence the decisions of the two groups will be different.

Lunch time; mostly lunch is a good mix of south and north Indian foods. A separate Jain food counter is also there. We get some free time after lunch, in which we either do assignments or study for exams/quizzes. Most of us, anyway. 1:30 Classes resume, and they last till around 3, except on Mondays, when we have lab till 5:30. But, we are free on Mondays till 4, so that’s ok. 3:00 We are free to do whatever we want. Some of us go to the Aryabhatta block, to do one of two things: go to the library and study, or to the sports room to issue racquets or footballs. Else, we study in the hostel, or play in the ground (cricket/football; sometimes that depends on seniors) or in the courts(tt/badminton/basketball/tennis). Given the sheer number of things to study here, most choose the former(study) and play later. 4:45 We have Yoga twice a week. Batches are decided on the basis of roll number and this course is non-evaluative. Yoga lasts for 45 minutes and then we eat snacks, which comprises of well, a snack like Bhel Puri/Chaat and coffee/tea/milk(thankfully unlimited) and then go to play with friends. Some go to the library or their rooms to study. 7:30 Dinner time; thankfully no queues here at this time, dinner comprises of mostly the same diversity as in lunch and is very tasty (applies to all of the food in the mess). 8:00 We tend to study at this time; for quizzes/assignments which seem to follow us everywhere we go. However, if one feels like playing, he/she is in luck: 8/9 to 11/12 finds many seniors in the courts and many first years in the canteen eating something at the canteen(which is open till 2AM); all hail Maggi - saviour of students’ hunger since time immemorial. Although we have many more items in the canteen which is very affordable, considering it is in Bangalore. Of course, late nights find you seldom in your room, many friends are seen in groups, talking, playing or studying. 12:00 I sleep mostly at around this time(that was the plan, anyway). If it’s someone’s birthday, we celebrate it in the mess till around 1:30. I hope this answer gives you an insight into what a IIIT-B first year student experiences, do come and experience the magic for yourself.

Considering the above, students who took up admissions at IIIT-B have had other choices of colleges but picked IIIT-B nonetheless because of the belief that someday down the time-line, this college is gonna make it big. Now to answer your question, only IIIT-B students are the ones who think that its one of the top institutions is because One can comment on a college/organisation only if they are a part of it, having known it intimately.People not belonging to the IIIT-B culture cannot appreciate the faculty or its curriculum since they haven't experienced it first hand. Also people tend to be wary of new courses and since no batch of iMTech IIIT-B has graduated yet, its simply not known as much as other top institutions. IIIT-B simply hasn't made its mark in the undergraduate scene and is still languishing in the hidden alcoves of anonymity. IIIT-B is not currently a top institution in the undergraduate scene but has all the making and markings of being one in near future which will be when the first batch of iMTech graduates in 2017. The faculty, curriculum, peers, labs and industry connect is top notch, comparable to top CS/EC institutions. It is because of this prediction that IIIT-B is considered by its students to be a top CS/EC institution and I see no wrong it that. After all its on premise of better future prospects of the college, that students join the new IITs. But then IIIT-B doesn't have to defend and prove itself on various fronts of faculty and facilities as the aforementioned might have to. Hopefully that answers your question.

Not many prefer a 5 year course which lessens the number of students applying. Do encourage many more to be a part of this wonderful environment and see the cutoff soar high! Again, a word of caution - ranks in entrance exams are not 'necessarily' the best judge of performance in a college atmosphere, especially one that tries to take students beyond the 'book'. The point on average package - you will be able to find these details once the first batch passes out. In the meantime I can vouch for a wonderful set of internships (both industrial and research) that the iMTech batches can boast of. The students at IIITB do their best to present draw enough new entrants to experience the quality learning environment here.

IIITB has an excellent faculty, with almost all professors being Ph.D's form great colleges like PSU, Cornell, IISc, MIT, Purdue, Berkley, EPFL etc. DAIICT also has some great professors but when we look at faculty as whole, IIITB wins hands down.IIITB>DAIICT                                                                  2.      Peers: IIITB doesn't have any reservation and the admission is on the basis of JEE-MAINS marks only. So there is no dilution in the quality of students who join the institute. Thus the peers you come in contact with are of superior quality than those in other colleges which practice reservation like DAIICT(50% reservation for Gujarat students).IIITB>DAIICT3.      Industry connections and Internships: IIITB is in the heart of India's ""Silicon valley"", Bangalore. It is in close proximity of companies like Siemens, Bosch, HP, IBM, Microsoft, Google etc. Along with this, many professors have ties with people in key positions in industry and academia. This makes it easier for students to land internships with big companies like IBM in their very 1st/2nd year. Many students have got fully funded foreign internships at MIT(USA), and in countries like Australia and Germany. Students at DAIICT also have some decent internship opportunities but the number of internship options that IIITB has due to its ""Silicon Valley Advantage"" are much more than those at DAIICT.IIITB>DAIICT4.      Coding/ Learning Culture: The proximity of IIITB to big companies and its location in Bangalore give it a major edge. Students of IIITB have the opportunity of participating in many hackathons organised throughout Bangalore including, but not limited to GoogleCodePersuit, Intel IOT Hackathon, Open Hack Day(Yahoo) and many more. Students also take part in various technical talks held in Bangalore like Google DevFest, Intel IOT roadshows and Microsoft TechFest, just to name a few. Competitive coding culture of IIITB is also blooming with students performing well on online portals like Hackerrank, SPOJ & Codechef. DAIICT is doing well at GSoc but other than that, students don't have access to hackathons or technical fests which is a major setback.IIITB>DAIICT5.       Placement: 1st batch of iMTECH program is yet to go for placement but the MTECH placements are really good with companies like Cisco, Flipkart, Amazon, Yahoo, Microsoft hiring student.iMTECH students are also expected to have similar placements, if not better as the iMTECH course is considered even better than the MTECH course. DAIICT also boasts of great placements in companies like Amazon, Morgan Stanley and Flipkart but many students are hired by companies like TCS and Infosys which offer less opportunities for growth.IIITB=DAIICT6.      Curriculum: The curriculum of  ICT-CS and and IIITB are quite similar and are both up to date with the industry standards but iMTECH course of IIITB will provide you with research experience and an MTECH degree that is much sought out in today's IT and CS sector. DAIICT on the other hand requires you to do mandatory rural internship. This gives student a unique exposure. Thus, both IIITB and DAIICT provide similar yet unique curriculum.IIITB=DAIICT7.       Infrastructure: DAIICT has a massive campus as compared to IIITB but IIITB is a specialised institute with a concentration on IT. Thus there is no need of a large campus. That said, IIITB has all facilities required for sports enthusiasts, including volleyball, basketball, cricket, football and table tennis. The academic block hosts all the labs that are up to date and modern. This gives the college a refined and sophisticated look. DAIICT too has a great campus and infrastructure with all the facilities. The labs a fully equipped state-of-the art infrastructure. The campus contains all the basic requirements including a sports and cultural complex. Both campuses are quite modern and are WiFi enabled.IIITB<DAIICT8.      Campus Life: Campus life of DAIICT is better than IIITB in terms of fests and clubs. This is due to the fact that IIITB has a relatively new iMTECT program and was earlier an MTECH institute; hence there was no need for fests or clubs. There is an annual sports fest called SPANDAN. On the other hand DAIICT has Synapse held every year along with many clubs that students can choose from.IIITB<DAIICT9.      Startup Culture: Both colleges have successful incubation centres that help students by providing monetary assistance and guidance.See also:i) 50 Amazing Startup Incubators and Accelerators in Indiaii) DA-IICT Centre for Entrepreneurship and Incubationiii) IIIT-B for StartupsIIITB=DAIICT Final Tally: IIITB:DAIICT=7:5 Reference:1.

Most of them are research projects. Places are like MIT,USA ; Australia ; and Germany. 4. Faculty - B=D . 5. Reputation and Alumni Base - B>D :-i) IIITB started in 1998 and IIITD in 2008. 6. Research Oriented People - B=D. 7. Campus Life - D>B :-i) More fests, intra-college competitions and organised clubs at IIITD. 8. Coding Culture - B>D. 9. Labs and Research Centers - B>D :- i) You can check yourself the number of labs in the Admission Brochure of both institutes and you will get your answer i.e IIITB.ii) See the link for infrastructure at IIITB Infrastructure :: 10. Startup Culture - B>D :-i) A full dedicated website for startups by IIITB - IIIT-B for Startupsii) A successful Incubation Center at IIITB.iii) See 50 Amazing Startup Incubators and Accelerators in India which has clearly mentioned IIITB Innovation Center in its list. With approximately equal fees at both institutes , the hostel and mess facilities are good in both. IIITD has air-conditioned mess and hostel (considering the weather at Delhi) which also gets reflected in the fees :P. I also like to mention and rectify the flaws in the answer given by Shreyas Iyer :- 1. i) IIITD ,IIITB and IIITH are all based on PPP (Public-Private Partnership) model. Purely Govt. is IIITA. ii) Hence in all these institutes they have state-funding for projects,labs and many other things. I would also like to mention that IIITD has to follow the reservation system according to Delhi Govt laws. So they will not be able to  select students on the basis of only JEE-Mains Marks like DTU and NSIT. 2. i) The syllabus of iMTech is totally different from MTech's. And it's high time that iMTech Curriculum is given due credit because of its relevance and scope. I already mentioned the internships of the first batch of iMTech. ii) I know coding or competitive programming is a vital part of CS. But after visiting so many Hackathons around Bangalore (Intel IOT, Google Code Pursuit)and looking at the current IT scenario and the growing trend of IOT (Internet Of Things), everyone should know the applications of coding which is why Electronics part is necessary (see Arduino) . Then anybody who can embed code and electronics will surely go a long way. 3. i) IIITD and IIITB both have top infrastructure.  However, the location aspect of IIITB (in Electronics City,Bangalore in the heart of the Silicon valley surrounded by the head offices of major companies like infosys etc)  is a very big factor and provides a first hand glimpse of real life working conditions.  ii) Living in Noida , I visited IIITD campus more often than that of IIITB. I have an idea of both institutes' campuses. The classrooms in IIITB have an awesome ambience and an atmosphere conducive to learning (one of the reasons I chose IIITB). 4. i) The faculty of IIITD and IIITB is one of the finest in India. ii) The director of IIITB , Dr S.Sadagopan , is one of the most respected personalities in view of his experience, work and contributions to the IT sector, with the inclusion of IIITB. I mentioned this point looking at the current status of directors of colleges like IIT-Jodhpur and IIT-Delhi. Also I also want to comment on the links given in the same answer :- 1) First Link is for 2015 recommended best CS/IT colleges. Last year I saw this author's blog of 2011 recommending the best CS/IT colleges many times. Looking at the comments section of both lists , people have questioned the author why he did not mention IIITB . In 2011 , he replied that there is no UG program in IIITB (It started in 2012) and now in 2015 he said that he hasn't visited the campus as of yet. According to him also, the list requires updating. 2) Second link - rankings of IIITD,IIITH,DTU and NSIT. Not related with the question asked above. But yes , it provided the correct facts. Now response to the answer by an Anonymous person . To him/her, I did not come up with a conclusion that IIITB is better. And nor IIITD. It is for the people to decide and not us. Our job is to put facts on the table and not the results. So here I rectify again :)   - 1. If we look into the fees of IIITH,IIITB and IIITD .....IIITD has the highest among them all. (that does not show it is fully govt) 2. Also we have done in total 4 projects in first year (2 in first sem for C and Python ;  2 in second semester in Basic Electronics Theory (analog circuits) and Basic Electronics Lab (digital circuits and coding in Arduino) ). If there is time u can see my Github Profile suprgyabhushan (Suprgya Bhushan)  where I put up my all codes and the projects. Also the projects are done in a professional way with all the proposals , progress reports, demonstrations and videos done. All projects were credited courses. 3. Again , IIITB and IIITD both have top infrastructure for academics. The classrooms of IIITB are not merely lecture halls !!!! I have attached the link for infrastructure of IIITB above. 4. People call Bangalore the Silicon Valley of India justly due to its higher scope of conducting coding competitions , hackathons , organised developer groups (GDG Bangalore, Microsoft and Intel-IOT),and for being the hub of many IT companies(duh !!!) . The anonymous person clearly mentioned in his/her answer ""Also most of the students are placed in Bangalore"". Need I say more? 5. i) Thanks to the anonymous person telling us about the Director of IIITD. I looked up both the institutes' directors before and both their work is too good!!! It's just that I can only write about director of IIITB because I know him well just like the anonymous person, being a student of IIITD does about their director. ii) Also it would be better if more links and information can be provided about the startup companies incubated at IIITD just as I have provided above. 6. According to most people's opinion, the number of GSoCers from any college is not the measure of how good the college is ... why ? because people do what they want to do. There is no social obligation to clear gsoc ( even though the money paid is good ;). It's an individual's choice to apply in GsoC, not the responsibility of the college. BTW how many are selected from MIT, Stanford, Princeton, CMU? :) Finally , I would like to say that IIITD and IIITB both require hard-working students with respect to its rigorous time-table of assignments, quizzes and coding. So its your turn to see the comparisons made in every area and make a list of them. Rank them according to your priorities and then the choice is yours.

In terms of research: Instead of taking subjects in the 2nd semester, a student can take either Project Elective(P.E.), where he/she has to take on a real life problem and implement it by the end of semester(Most of the time full credits are given in this if implemented correctly). Other one is Research Elective(R.E.), where a student has to research about his/her favorite topic and consult a faculty who works on the particular domain. He/she has to then come up with a proposal to either publish a paper or research about already published one. In both of these cases, the student has to take elective under a faculty. The faculty can provide you with all the resources you need via college for you to work on. I myself have taken a P.E. in 2nd semester. In terms of core electronics placement: While the above answer applies on both IT and ESD, there are few no. of core companies visit for ESD. I am the 2nd batch in ESD, and I have seen how 1st batch got placed.

Also, Average salary entirely depends on ""what you can offer to companies"".

The standards expected of you by companies which hires you will be quite high. Even at bare minimum if you just go through the academics of 2 years in IIIT-B you should be good enough to join any IT organisation as a Senior <Whatever> (bare minimum). Risk analysis is good but asking questions like ""what if I don't get placed after 2 years"" is puerile. In the past, most of the students who graduated from IIIT-B have chosen where they want to offer their time/skills rather than the other way around.

IIIT Allahabad being central govt. owned has ample funding, great infrastructure, low fees and very good placements ( I hear they went around 10 lpa for B-Techs in 2015). But since it is govt owned , there are many side effects as well like reservation , internal politics etc. It has one of the best coding environment and decent course structure.IIIT Bangalore is built on PPP model. There is no reservation, course structure is based on current industry requirements and has decent placements. But outside Bangalore it is not as renowned as Allahabad or Hyderabad. Also it needs to improve in coding environment if its students want to grab opportunities at many coding based jobs like Directi, Google etc.IIIT Hyderabad for now is better in terms of intake cutoff, coding environment and placements. Many companies like Topcoder, Microsoft, Directi etc organize coding events at IIIT-H and  it has been consistently performing great in ACM, GSOC etc. This is also reflected in placements where avg onshore CTC went around 15 for UGs and 12 for PGs along with 15-16 offshore offers in 2015. It however lags behind Allahabad in funding and infrastructure. ",0.39573749999999996,Positive,3.791475,0.0660377358490566,1,4.791475,3.791475

It all started because of Vikram Singh who promised to the Spandan Organizing Committee that we'd make something like a Virtual Stock Trading Game. He made this promise somewhere around 10th Feb and our exams were starting from 26th Feb, we had no time at all. Even though Vikram had promised to the organizing committee, we on our side lost the confidence completely, we knew we couldn't do it and it was impossible for us. It was the ""EGO"" we had which kept us going.  A month before Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham, Amritapuri (if I'm not wrong)  made a stock trading game and we were badly addicted to it and we always wanted to make something better than that - and we used to say this always - ""If they can do it, why can't we?"".  Before Mid-Term ExamAt around 10 days before exam we realized that we were running out of time and if we had to make it then we had to start it anyhow. The Organizing Committee was pretty sure that we won't be able to do it so they didn't even care to put up a prize (not even a certificate) for this event or list it on the Spandan Webpage - it was completely meaningless to them. I remember we spent 3-4 nights in the Computer Lab figuring out how to do it - getting closer to the mark by every passing day. We divided ourselves into teams - Apoorv Vikram Singh was working on the Login Module, Aditya Paliwal and Krishna were working on getting the live values, Padhi, Shivam, were working on the UI and Database. I was working on the Database, UI and integration part trying to keep the code base in sync. I remember the first night when we started discussing about the project - None of us knew php, SQL, JavaScript, etc . I remember we were having problems in setting up MySQL on our computers - but luckily things fell in place and thanks to Google (company) and Stack Overflow (website) which gave answers to every problem we came across.  There are many fun stories related to how it impacted our grades - ranging from getting ""Zero"" in electronics quiz to almost ""failing"" in Math mid-term exam - but let's not talk about it here please! ;)  Post -Mid Term ExamOur entire team left for home except for 3-4 of us, apparently even we had lost hopes that we'd be able to do it. I remember working with Siddharth Padhi and Krishna in those last moments, it was fun - Padhi is the perfect guy to work in a team with, we synced up things, finished it off and were late by 3 days :D , We ran the game for just 2 days - inside college (It was hosted on my laptop but we made it accessible to those outside the campus also using reverse proxy) and we got 300 registrations - yes it was much lesser than Vidyut but we did it in two days and that too with a buggy system - we never claimed that we had the best thing, we know what we made was no big deal - but what makes us happy about whatever happened that time was that we started believing in ourselves, we knew that if we worked together as a team, we can pull off even what we call impossible!

For a long time, IIIT-B had it's own entrance exam which was drop dead easy. Extremely trivial logical multiple choice questions. The toughness of the entrance exam and the popularity of the institute is highly related.2. A large portion of post-graduate students apply via GATE/CAT, etc. IIIT-B did not accept GATE scores for quite some time.3. IIIT-B did not have a graduate (B.Tech, etc.) program until recently. The number of people who apply to graduate programs in India is much higher than people who apply to post-graduate programs - which in turn decides how well the institute is known.4. No elite-ness criteria is required to join the institute - ie. my batch-mates/college-mates (myself included) were not exceptional in any which way because IIIT-B itself did not have a very high acceptance bar.5.

It is you who are responsible for your choice.   2) List down the pros and cons of the college/courseCons:1) Relatively a New Course: The iMtech course just began in 2012, and the first batch would pass out in 2017. This is one reason you might want to consider other options.2) Not a large campus:The campus of IIIT Bangalore perhaps might be one of the smallest campuses among all engineering colleges in India.3) The beginning culture:The clubs in IIIT are in their infant stages, apart from the Music club, ISS club and few others. As the new batches are coming in, new and new clubs are being formed. Also, my batch had no immediate seniors to discuss projects, and hence that is bit of a disadvantage I feel. Pros:1) The Faculty:Hands down, this is the strongest pro of the college. With professors from MIT, University of California Berkeley, Cornell University and Purdue University, this distinguishes the college from the rest. Not only this, the professors have strong industry links. Refer to this link for more details.Page on iiitb.ac.in2)Alumni Network and Seniors: With well-placed Alumni in companies like Yahoo, Amazon, Intuit, Flipkart, Morgan Stanley, Cisco, Siemens etc. students need not have to worry about their placements. There are international exchanges where students come from best of the universities of the world for working with professors/startups. The presence of the MTech seniors is an asset for the undergrads, as they are always willing to help in projects, give their guidance and share their industry experience. Also, the PhD scholars and MS scholars have published some of the best research papers, which is an inspiration for the research enthusiasts3) The Course: The iMtech course is in itself complete and unique. Suitable timings, courses accompanied by labs and projects, internship at the end of the third year, the choice to choose your stream are some of the highlights.4) Potential for growth: You see the clubs being formed right in front of you. In fact, it is the students who take up initiatives, join and form new committees in college, organize fests and other events. The work which the junior iMtech batches have been doing deserves a special mention here. Other than this, iMtech students participate in various hackathons / coding competitions and the coding culture is picking up.   3) Objectively decideUse Excel and give weights to the criteria you did your research on, say on a scale of five. Assign a score to each criteria of a particular college. Do the Math and arrive at a score for each college. This in general, I feel is the best method when you are confused with choices.   4) Visit the collegeBefore you join, visit the top two-three colleges (as per your scores given), as sometimes this gives you more insight than anything else. Try to interact with a few professors, students or alumni of the college.I had the option of choosing between some of the top NITs, BITS Pilani (Hyderabad and Goa) and IIITs. I chose IIIT Bangalore.

Overlay networks have been around for a long time. There was a project called X-Bone, which allowed you to create your own. MPLS is an overlay network of sorts. A set of GRE tunnels between computers, where you can route from tunnel to tunnel, would probably be the most trivial. So the first question that the thesis wants to answer is “what exactly is a Software Defined Network and how does it relate to Overlay Networks in general?” Without knowing what is meant by a SDN, without defining the term before use, it’s just a term without a definition. You want to frame the research by describing what makes an SDN an SDN, preferably as a citation of a paper that has examined in depth that precise question. Citations are always to be preferred to axiomatic declarations of what things are. Ideally, this part is going to end up a couple of paragraphs, where you define the subset of primary terms that needs to be understood prior to reading the thesis. This might be prefixed by, or lead into, the actual question you are asking. Your supervisor can cover that part. But this isn’t just so that they understand, it’s also so that you understand. There is a lot of overlapping terminology in this field and you need to be able to recognize what is important and what isn’t without having to dig through the work. Now, the thesis itself. As others have noted, there are a great many areas being explored there and are open to exploration. This problem needs to be reduced, somehow, so that you can pick a subject. Let us examine the three key sorts of network usage that exist: Internet. No service guarantees, a complete amalgam of different topology types, no particular design philosophy, evolutionary.Extranet. A single organization with a single logical network split up into multiple physical networks. Very common layout. Extranets may utilize the Internet, but most of those I’ve encountered are using guaranteed level of service MPLS links over business-only lines. I won’t comment on the number of disclaimers in the small print over the guarantee.Intranet. This is a single physical network within a corporation, although it may be broken into multiple logical networks.There are other types of network - high-performance, business-to-business, real-time, and so on, but if you’re dealing with SDNs then these are characteristics the SDN should be able to control within the limits of what the hardware can do, but it should all be parameters at that point. Finally, a number of people have mentioned security. But security is a big field. You have security against inspection at a lower level, security against inspection at the same level, security against denial-of-service, the question of protocol flaws that might make buffer overflows or underruns impossible to avoid, Rainbow Book requirements, etc. This means that we can reduce the problem space down to three questions. You can define overlay networks on the Internet - Tor does it all the time, as do all the IPv6 tunnels. But is there a characteristic that determines if an SDN is an appropriate solution in a given context?Are there any parameters that SDNs - by their very nature - cannot control? So, for example, could an SDN ever be real-time or high-performance, or does the mere fact that you have the extra layer in there break any of the service guarantees required by specific types of networks such as these?There are many places where SDNs could potentially be attacked, you can’t investigate them all, but are there any forms of security (such as packet labelling for security level) where SDNs are particularly valuable or particularly vulnerable?So far, we’ve narrowed the problem-space down to just a couple dozen lifetimes. An improvement, but not quite good enough. There should be one of those three questions that attracts your supervisor. Margaret M. Fleck (The Rabbit and the Thesis parable, USENET lore from old) Read, re-read, and understand why it’s absolutely critical why the question should interest the supervisor. Let’s say, for example, they say number 3 looks the most promising. You want to pick an area where there’s enough research you can cite to get a really impressive bibliography but not so much that it looks like all you’ve done is cut-and-paste quotes. So, the Rainbow Book’s security labels - although absolutely interesting, as you’re now dealing with SDNs inside SDNs with their own routing and firewall rules, is probably a bad topic for research for a Master’s. I’m not sure you can find enough quotable material. I’m not even sure if it has been studied. IPSec obviously deals with router-to-router encryption (the original function of it) and end-to-end encryption, so packet security can be seen as a voluntary problem. Although I wouldn’t recommend telling any network admin that. However, one might question the performance impact of router-to-router encryption over an SDN. The security of the routing mechanism is one area of interest. That’s why router-to-router encryption is an important issue. If someone could inject packets to send OSPF or ISIS routers into fits, someone could take down large chunks of an SDN and not just the area they were injecting packets into. It’s why BGP now supports encryption for router packets. For internal only protocols, it’s not a major threat, but if someone used SDNs to create extranets, then you’ve problems. However, is that really sufficient for a thesis? I can’t tell you how fast you can work or how thoroughly you would investigate such issues. And, again, it depends on the supervisor. The supervisor has to want the question answered. For my own Masters, I spent far, far too much time on politics, trying to get the department’s network team to let me do the work I was instructed by my supervisor to do. No, DOS drivers do not work for Linux. No, I’m not going to try to rewrite the Apache webserver to run under DOS. No, I don’t care if that means you have to provide me with a network card of the correct decade. No, I’m not interested in running the work under the department webserver, it’s the wrong OS, it provides the wrong feature set, I need system admin privileges to do the stuff I need to do under the hood, and I can’t deliver high-speed video off some pile of junk in the corner. I spent an equal amount of time arguing with my supervisor as to why software will only run on the OS it’s designed for, why multimedia is just a little hard to deliver from a heavily overloaded NT box and why - if I’m going to be able to complete my Master’s project - I need to be able to gather the data that I actually NEED to complete my Master’s project. Good grief, it was hard work! The project was trivial in comparison, even with everything I threw into it that was extra. Without the politics, I could have completed the original assignment in a month. Just as well, as the two computers special-built by the IT department both had hard drive crashes shortly after that. *hits head against wall repeatedly, wondering if the wall will crack first or his skull* This is what you absolutely don’t want. The nightmare scenario even hell didn’t want to touch. You need a supervisor on your side and passionate about your work. You have to be able to do the work, which means you have to have the supervisor willing to guard your back against any office politics. The project must come first, last and always. That’s what they give you the shiny bits of paper for at the end, not your ability to beat sense into others. Because the supervisor has to be willing to watch your back, you need them passionate about the work. I cannot stress that enough. They need to believe in it, and believe in its value. Pare down the above list of three main categories according to their research interests (which I do not know in this case and cannot know in the general case) until you’ve got two or three really good proposals. If they’re the sort who will be happy to choose from that or tailor one of them, then that’s what you present. If they want just one idea, you’ve done all you can, just pick one that you think appeals the strongest to both of you. Keep the other two ideas as backup, so if your first proposal falls flat, you simply move on to the next best bet.

One is an undergraduate course while the other one is a postgraduate program. The pros and cons of both are very different. Comparing the two would be like comparing apples to oranges. In other words, it is not quite possible to answer the question the way it is worded right now.] Edit: In response to the added details, I would say that both the programs are very young. iM.Tech was started around two years ago while IIIT-D was established in 2008. But there are advantages associated with youth. IIIT-D is aggressively hiring quality faculty members (I had the chance to interact with a couple of them before they joined) and moved to its new campus in Okhla in 2012, after operating from a transit campus at NSIT for nearly 4 years. They are also spending a lot of money in order to attract smart research scholars and PhD students in order to build a solid reputation for research.  From what I have heard about the iM.Tech program at IIIT-B, students are being coached very well. A lot of attention is being paid to the initial batches as they are the formative years during which the program will constantly be revised so as to meet the requirements of both the industry and the academia. Bangalore has also gone on a hiring spree after introducing the 5 year program. Several faculty members solely teach undergraduate courses. Students are encouraged to take part in competitions and often faculty mentors assigned in order to help them in such endeavours. Delhi has a slight advantage as far as placements are concerned because of already having graduated 3 batches. But, in my humble opinion, it is somewhat nullified by the fact that IIIT-B has had nearly 15 years to consolidate its reputation and that every Indian or multinational IT company worth its salt is based out of Bangalore. As far as other amenities are concerned, I can only speak for IIIT-B. The campus is rather minuscule which limits the scope of one's extra-curricular activities. We lack proper playgrounds and an auditorium. However the IT infrastructure is not lacking in any way and the labs are decently equipped as well. In case you are one to take into account such factors while making a decision, I suggest you talk to someone from IIIT-D as well. These are the facts. I cannot come to  conclusion in your stead because the weight I will assign to each of these factors will be different from yours. Good luck with the admission process!

CS/IT/CE Avg : 5.5–6 LPA ETC Avg : 4.5:5.5 LPA EEE Avg: 4–5 LPA And Think about after 4 years when you will graduate these might(WILL!!) change to CS/IT/CE Avg : 9–11 LPA ETC/EEE Avg : 6–8 LPA A guy from EEE cleared 2 rounds of Directi So you never know!! Our Training and placement cell is working very hard, even for a batch of 240 students we have almost 30–35 Companies recruting On-Campus If you are amongst the top 10% of your whole batch you can easily fetch 10LPA+ offer. Which is like top 25 out of a batch of 240 you will be definitely placed well. Which is the story in each and every college, even IIT's!! Institute will help in getting companies to campus with attractive offers but its you who will perform in the test and the interview. If you are not considering IIIT Bh just because of placements you can take my word that you are going to regret later for sure. From 2015 onwards Admission in IIIT Bh is being done through JEE Mains Marks so you would see a hell lot of difference in batches 2015–2019 onwards (16–20,17–21). From this year 3rd year students are undergoing mock interviews and mock tests from 6th Semester only. So, definitely there is going to be a lot of improvement in placements in coming years(very soon). Otherwise the environment here is pretty good,very clean,calm and beautiful place with pleasant weather. As there are 3 different full form of IIIT's in India IIIT Bh : International Institute of Information Technology,Bhubaneswar. Which is same as that of IIIT Hyderabad and IIIT Bangalore. Just go for it as u will always have that *IIIT Tag* over the XYZ private colleges and other regional colleges/Lower NITs. Always keep in mind Branch>College. Peace ☮️ Update 1: Recently 7 students from IIIT Bh got selected for Google Summer of Code 2018 (GSOC).

In my opinion you should go to CET/Burla/Silicon if you are getting them before considering IIIT Bh. IIIT Bh has ~0 alumni network incomparison to CET/Burla.its only 9 years old with 80%+ alumni working in service based companies like TCS,Infosys, Wipro who are of no help if you want to try off campus.Alumni scarcity can be made-up by experienced faculty members which unfortunately it lacks as well. The answer is coming from an IIIT Bh third year CSE undergrad,who has friends in Burla,CET,Silicon and couple of other private colleges.

Please read my other answer for a better understanding How is the workload in IIITB for iMTech students? Do students need to work on Saturday and Sundays also?   I am also posting our IIITB professor answer here for non-Facebook Quorians. Below are the excerpts from his post :- ""Hi All.  I am Dr. Ashish Choudhury, an assistant professor at IIITB.  Through this post, I would try to answer some of the general  questions and clear some of the common mis-conceptions about CS and  IIITB that people have in their mind. First of all, what exactly is CSE  (computer science and engineering)? Is it just coding, writing programs,  making apps? No, not at all, in fact none of this CSE; then you might  be wondering what is CS? So remember the term ""science"" and  ""engineering"" associated with CSE. So definitely writing codes and  creating apps cannot be considered as science and engineering. Its like  the same that a doctor who studies medical science does not learn how to  design a stethoscope or the internal details of stethoscope during his  MBBS; for a medical science student its just a tool for something else.  Similarly, an astronomer is not taught how to design a telescope; for  him its just a tool for some other purpose. In the same, CSE is not  about coding and creating app alone. Of course codes are important, but  they play the same analogous role of a stethoscope or a telescope. CS is  actually a methematical science, where we learn how to design algrithms  for various interesting  and real-world problems. Once you design an  algorithm and have its analysis done, by writing a program you verify  whether indeed your algorithm achieves what it claimed. CS has so many  interesting domains, such as theoretical computer science, data  sciences, networking and communication, system designs, etc. Each of  these domains further encompasses several other sub-topics. For ex,  theoretical computer science includes data-structures, algorithms,  discrete maths, theory of computation, cryptography, etc. Other domains  encompasses other fascinating topics like machine learning, artificial  intelligence, computer vision, image processing, big-data analytics,  databases, to name a few. So CS teaches you these sciences over the  period of 4-5 years and not just coding. The other side of CSE includes  the design and engineering of the computer architecture, like VLSI,  hard-ware engineering. So in a nut-shell CSE is much much more than just  writing C/Java codes and making apps. Of course you should eventually  learn how to code and make apps, but before that you should know how to  analyse a problem and find an algorithm for the same and for which you  need to know the science aspect of the computer science!!  Now the  next important thing is how IIITB compares with other institute. I will  honestly put my view regarding the same here amd my goal is to not  mislead the students and their wards. I will definitely not compare  IIITB with the CSE of premier old IITs (Delhi, Kanpur, Bombay and Madras  only) and the CSA of IISc because they are definitely way ahead of  IIITB in ALL aspects. My comparison will be ONLY with IIT Guwahati,  other IIITs, the new IITs, other govt colleges, NITs and reputed private  colleges. I will do the comparison based on following factors:  1. Quality and number of faculty members and the domain they represent:  Just see our faculty profile; we have excellent faculties in every  domain with minimum qualification of PhD (from reputed national and  international institutes like IIT/IISc/MIT/Berkley/EU universities) and  several years of experience in academic/teaching/industry. With respect  to this parameter, we can be compared ONLY with IIITH, IIITD and IIT  guwahati. You take any new IITs; most of them are struggling to get new  faculty members, they have not moved to their permanent campuses and  they are just carrying with the brand IIT name. In fact in one of the  new IITs, due to shortage of faculty, the student are not exposed to the  hot subjects like cryptography, machine learning, big-data analytics,  IOT, etc. The situation is more or less the same in NITs and other  private colleges. Just see their faculty profile, their academic  qualifications and the domains they reprsent. Clearly the only  competitor with IIITB will be IIITH and IIITD.  2. Research  oppurtunities: With respect to this we can be compared ONLY with the new  IITs, IITG, IIITH and IIITD. You hardly get any challenging research  oppurtunities of International reputation at the remaining places (NITs  and other private colleges). Research oppurtunities actually depend upon  the faculty members and the domains they represent because if you have  good faculty then only you can work with them on interesting problems.  If someone wants to develop research capabilities and want to pursue a  research career in the future then definitely one should consider the  above listed colleges. 3. Placement: I think people will expect  me to put this criteria at the first position, but for me this is a  secondary parameter compared to the first two. The reason is the  following: the placement is ""good"" in all the colleges that I am  discussing. Good in the sense that if the student does well in their 4-5  years of study then irrespective of these colleges, he/she will get a  very good package on an average at the end. There might be some special  cases when someone may get an extravagant package but believe me  institutes reputation hardly have any impact on them. Moreover, the  entire placement thing is market driven. Now the IT market is very good  and we are getting good jobs. But do remember what hapenned after 9/11  or when the IT market crashed few years back; at that time placement was  ""equally"" hardhit even at premier IITs. So what I am saying is that  just by getting admission to a particular college there is no guarantee  you will get a good job if you do not work hard. If you work hard you  will get job irrespective of the college (remember I am comparing only  few colleges). But the crucial part is if along with a good job, you  also want to learn CSE, then ONLY IIITH, IIITD and IIT guwahati are  comparable.   4. Ranking: For me this is a completely bogus  parameter, which seriously mis-lead the students and wards. The ranking  is done on completely vague parameters. How can you compare an NIT with  IIITB? NIT has several departments while IIITB has only one. The  comparison should be only between CSE NIT and IIITB. On most of the  ocassion the comparison is just based on placements. But as I said  above, if just a job is your only goal then God should save you. If you  work hard, then irrespective of the college you will get a very good  job. But when it comes to the learning and research aspect then clearly  IIITB will be ahead of NITs and other private colleges.  What I  will suggest is that you should do the comparison based on parameter 1  and 2 only; job you will get everywhere if you work hard. I hope  everyone all the best. And I ensure the wards of the students that IIITB  will be definitely a very good choice for their wards. ""    Hope the qn has been answered.

As she had high hopes from Thorogood,  she was waiting for results eagerly,  Finally the results were out and she did not clear for the Thorogood position. She was crying continuously, it felt as if she has lost all the confidence in her. With such a crying face, she was going back to her room after deciding not to try for NetApp's position.

Finally she was in Examination room appearing for written round but still crying. Even I was appearing for its written round, but my entire focus was on her, I was constantly consoling her to pay full attention in the current examination and forget about Thorogood. She somehow managed to write some of the answers and left the Examination room and went back to her room.  She was still crying in her room when she came know that she cleared the written round and was called for interview. She cleared the first round of interview, she even cleared the second round. During this period, I was constantly telling her to be positive. After the third round she was finally selected for the NetApp's QA position.

And so, I toddled meekly to him and asked, ""Maga, Can we go home every weekend? Do we have to inform the warden of our absence?"" And for a moment his reaction made you think if you were a third standard student asking a senior if it is perhaps just fine to use a pen instead of a pencil. But, since the answer was a positive one, I did not mind much and walked on.  I had already started forming devilish opinions about this lad and that is when it was announced he was one of the lads who is going to be a TA for our Maths exams. Preparatory Semester Test 1: MH2-GF-RW : Rahul, Pareetosh, Karthik Kunjithapatham ,Pratheek and Pratik in one of the top floors of the college. The scene was perfectly set. Pareetosh writes. Pratik orchestrates the session and would be passing the nuggets to either  Kartik or me.  In strides our man, Akshay. It was only 10 minutes past the exam and I could see Karthik already showing signs of a man who knows the water is near the nose and unless Pratik helps we were doomed. This is the expression that I wanted to see too. I did not want do drown alone either. And we weren't the thickest of friends in preparatory semester.  Akshay, who we thought would be one of those chaps who would perhaps be passing the time during invigilation noticing the more beautiful birds from the female sex infact sees us. Perhaps, the lack of eye-catching birds from the other sex should be blamed. But, that is an argument which we can ignore.  BANG! BUSTED. Well, he does not ask us to leave the exam hall but shifts us each to the north, south, east  sides of the room. It would not have made much of a difference if he had politely asked us to leave the room .  FAIL it was. Back to hostel rooms. Our wing is fairly happy that all the inmates of our wing have failed the test and there would be no shortage of company.  Test 2: This time, having learnt the lessons we made an early entry and our arrangements were more subtle than the previous test. We also learnt a few formulae to help us.  5 minutes pass by. We are made to inhabit the farther corners.  Fail again. Test 3: Akshay now firmly reminded us of the old English teachers in your high school who would peer through her glasses for anything strangely malicious. Sinister, we thought this guy is.  And so, I failed again! 8.5 out of 25 it was. Needed another 0.5 Another TA made some magical marks appear on my paper and the only soul who could afford me the marks was Akshay. And, so i went to him. And he said NO again. Wrath, Pure Wrath.  Finally, TA2 makes another request and Akshay relents. I get my 0.5 finally and thus, I passed my first test in IIITB. I would have liked to continue the rest of my story on how the wounds healed and he became one of those senior fellows who earned respect without expecting it out of virtue of being a TA. He also is distinctly one of the few senior TAs who did not become a TA in order to seek female acquaintance easily! Not that, there was lack of any in his case!:P And then as most good stories end, I and Karthik gave up copying completely, we started loving mathematics and we never wrote re-tests again. Err, well Karthik once wrote in OS.:P You don't take up subjects like MAS and safety-critical systems just like that!:D ",0.1178901639344262,Positive,3.235780327868852,0.04716981132075472,1,4.235780327868852,3.235780327868852

Everybody is aware of Prof GNS Prasanna, his level of teaching, and his expectations from a student. Well, once he set up an algo paper... So here I was, playing table tennis in MH2, with my best friend a day before my Algo exam in 1st sem. Course is too diverse and vast to prepare anything I thought, I can anyway write enough to pass. After all, I had four years of experience of filling sheets from my graduation. I reached the examination hall with my friend, slightly nervous, but happy that algo nightmare will finally be over. Little did I know that my nightmare is about to become a deja vu, and is knocking on my door to haunt the crap out of me. I take the seat, and my friend behind me. TA's start distributing a very thick bundle of printed papers, which looks like a photocopy of lecture notes. My first reaction ""Open book exam !! Mann this prof is cool ! "". And then, I got that bundle of sheets, my face starts changing colours. Becomes red from shame followed by pale yellow off the fear and finally blue due to sudden loss of oxygen from my body. I look at everybody else and took a huge sigh of relief when all my friends have same reaction, ""At least I won't fail alone."" I flip through the 30 page booklet of question paper, hoping to find at least one question which I can attempt, to my dismay, there were none. The guy sitting in front me me never looked up once he started writing, but obviously I couldn't cheat. This was a master's course after all, not your graduation. People are more mature and professional here. You all must be wondering, where is the TA in this story, but little do you all know. TA is the hero, the saviour, the knight in this story. I will not take his name, let's call him Bhuppi.  So, when I had given up all hope and was promising myself and god that I will be super serious from next sem, just get me through this one (never happened), I felt a hand on my shoulder. Yes folks, the silent guardian had arrived. I look up to see it was Bhuppi, he says the most beautiful phrase I have ever heard ""Tum fail hoge to bezzatti to meri hogi na"" (If you fail in this exam, it will be my insult.) And then he smiled and gave me a nod, pointing to the answer sheets lying by the side of guy in front of me (who never stopped writing).  He then went and stood at the door, asking all of us not to make any kind of noise, other than that, do whatever is necessary to pass. Everything else is history. I passed with a C grade. Score eighty something marks in a 170 marks paper, which was fine by me.  I hope, that TA is reading this answer. Hope he accepts this thank you from me. :) P.S: I shall deem the above literature a work of fiction (in case any of the professors) are reading. I am not to be held responsible if somebody believes this urban legend. ",0.20867906976744185,Positive,3.4173581395348838,0.04716981132075472,1,4.417358139534883,3.4173581395348838

The in charge had told me when the painter/repair man comes they will inform me, its been a year, no progress. Even I've stopped mailing them now.The food is OK OK. But the money they charge is 4k per month. In 4k I could have ordered dabba services from outside and get better food. This is the 3rd time the caterer has been changed in a span of 10 months.Hardly any extracurricular activities. There is just one cultural event and one sports event that too only within college. Only college students participate and college students watch. No inter-college events, no organized fests, where students can compete with other colleges.Per month the college charges 27k, and the amount of lectures and other facilities are hardly comparable to the fees. Yes the teachers are above average, but defiantly not best! Some teachers are just average. More can be learned by joining online courses.There are no facilities for even basic medicines. No crocine, no bandages! You have to go out to even by basic medicines. At least the bare minimal like paracetamol and bandages should be in college I feel. How do I know its not there? I asked for it! The receptionist said “sorry, we don't have it”!Good luck finding books in library. The library is 4/5, better than the above points, still they did not have Algorithm book of Horowitz and Sahni. Very few machine learning books, too. The librarian will not help you either(the female one)!The research facilities are not that great as they advertise!Pros: Great placements. Almost all students will not only be placed, but will have one of the best job offers in the country.Video lectures. Some of the lectures are recorded, so in case students want to rewatch it its available.WiFi access 24*7. Speed is average. But the WiFi keeps running even if there is no electricity.Generators are always on when electricity goes. So its good. I've never had electricity issue.The environment and infrastructure is good. I don't know if it's because of the college, or because Bangalore is good for greens.The crowd are ofcouse one of the best, as most students are bright and there are no reservations either. So admission is only on merit base. Students are quite good.Earlier there was no gym, now they have made a gym. Which is nice. Obviously they have increased the fees for that. But it's reasonable, unlike the other pricing.Overall, if I had to take admission again, I'd not come to IIITB unless I have a scholarship.

IIIT-B has some of the best profs in the country, gamut of interesting courses, talented alumni who are spread across 100 odd MNC's and an active startup mindset. We are young institute and we have already begun to rock the floor.  The onus of making IIIT-B grow to the level of older IIT's rests more in the hands of students. As students we have all the freedom to learn more, code more, compete in programming duels,  build better projects, collaborate and write good research papers, participate in conferences, contribute to OpenSource. The time is yours, the faculty are yours, the labs, and the will power too. Life at IIIT-B is a golden life, only your alumni can tell you what they miss once they graduate. With focus, hard work and guidance,  IIIT-B can get better of the best IIT's too. ",0.46446000000000004,Positive,3.92892,0.05188679245283019,1,4.92892,3.92892

(That being said, there's enough room for Volleyball, Cricket, Basketball, Badminton and whatever else your imagination allows you to do with a little open space)-The building is a bit drab. (It's very professional and has really cool decor, but doesn't seem very college-y. Then again, beauty lies in the eyes of the beholder, and most people incidentally, are blown away by the campus)-The course (as you know) is quite young. (Now this isn't necessarily a bad thing. It's up to us to build a sort of culture for ourselves; something that you'd have to conform to in an older college)-Absolutely nothing else. Now for the pure positives:The course structure is a dream. You'd delve into the heart of IT from the very first semester, and how! Programming 101 has C and Python, and some really cool assignments to help getting used to different concepts in programming. We dabbled in robotics, encryption, compression, the works! Being an IT institute, the only course available provides a degree in IT, but this is a HUGE advantage, considering how super-specialized the institute and the faculty are for the same. While everyone gets the same degree in five years, your specialization(s) can vary. The most broad difference sets in in the fifth semester (third year), when you decide which stream to take up; Computer Science or Electronics. Until then, everyone goes through the same Basic Sciences and IT Core courses to build a solid foundation. Classes depend on the instructor of course, but the format has a common theme; being a class of only fifty people, the progress is tuned to match a common comfort level for everyone, and is VERY open and interactive. The general scheme of things is quite progressive here:-Virtually all classwork; be it an assignment or a lab report (away with hastily scribbling lab records!) is submitted through an online portal, and shifting to the electronic medium from the boredom of notebooks is quite gratifying-Quite a few of the exams allow free access to the internet and/or material saved on the computer ahead of time. This system is brilliant, as it does away with the age old bane of having to memorize facts, and lets you focus on ideas instead. (Having said this, none of the subjects (save bio and chem in the first semester) require you to memorize anything in the traditional sense. Everything is idea-centric)-The faculty here, being quite senior and accomplished in their fields, credit you with intelligence and more importantly, maturity, that makes the classroom interaction very profitable and satisfying. The significance of this is difficult to put in words. As for the environment, its really healthy. The institute is populated by some of the best faculty one could ask for in the country. There simply isn't enough space (or time) here to describe how incredible they are, in terms of ideas, experience, teaching methods and approachability (I can vouch for the faculty members I've interacted with so far, but I hear only good things about the others as well).Also, one of the things that sets IIITB apart is the fact that it's a research hub. While this hasn't really touched us on a significant level yet, our course in the later years will have a sort of research spin to it (the last couple of semesters is mainly thesis work, there's a start). As a side effect, this also means that some very accomplished individuals from the industry and academia drop in quite frequently for talks and such, and this can be (and already has been) vastly beneficial to anyone interested.As far as technology goes, the institute is really well funded, and everything is state-of-the-art, so no worries there (hard details can be found on enquiry, no point in my going into it here). Admission is based solely on JEE (mains, I think) ranks, and nothing else (provided you satisfy the minimum for the boards, of course). Check the website for further details. In addition to the stuff I've mentioned above, there are so many things that require too much time and patience to address at once that I've left out.If you're interested, post any queries you have specific to campus life, courses and whatnot at http://iiitb.forumotions.in/. Its a forum that we (students alone!) started specifically for iMTech aspirants and students to find stuff out about the course, and someone's got to set the ball rolling (be the first to post!). We're currently operating out of a tacky free domain, but we'll think about upgrading if it proves to be useful, so spread the word!

The environment and classes in IIITB force students to develop projects infact we generally had a project for each subject.And these projects are complex and will require team effort, however I have seen single guys completing the project by themselves.

All the 200 undergrads are enough aware about different fields in their interests. When asked, they have enough wisdom to express their opinion, just like other users do on Quora. Unawareness can be called as a factor, but as far as I’ve seen, we do talk about Quora posts, discuss about the posts, discuss about the opinions. And surprisingly, all those get involved who are not active on Quora, that being said - They know that Quora exists. And they know, that there is more philosophy than any righteous in thinking whether IITians are more active on Quora. Because at the end of the day, it doesn’t actually matter.
