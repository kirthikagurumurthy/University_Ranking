11,11,Birla-Institute-of-Technology-and-Science-Pilani-Pilani-Campus,"What is the internship culture in BITS Pilani, Hyderabad?",8,1,8/1,Yes,Followed,2020-07-16,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-internship-culture-in-BITS-Pilani-Hyderabad,"Disclaimer: I graduated in 2018, so whatever information I provide in this answer could very well be dated. For anyone wondering why everybody who goes to college seems to be so bothered about the institute’s internship culture, here’s the fact of the matter : internships land you jobs. Yes, you might either end up converting your internship into a full fledged full time job in the same company or use the experience gained from working as an intern to find a job of your need/ want. I sat for placements in the second semester of 2017 -18 and the placement performance of the campus was exceptional during that academic year, largely because a lot of people had converted their internships. According to official stats, about just over 90% of students who sought jobs had gotten placed and the ballpark of the number of job seekers who converted their internship was estimated to be around 40–50%. (The economy started to slow down in the very next term, so I don’t know if this momentum continued, largely because I haven’t kept a track of the campus placement record after I graduated). There are two distinct scenarios in which a student in any of the BITS campuses ends up doing an internship: The first is the official, coursework- linked internship module attached to a certain number of credits called Practice School which students do in order to fulfill their graduation requirements. We’ll address this scenario later in the answer. The second is the non coursework- linked internship that a student might want to do in order to gain knowledge/ experience about a certain domain they are looking to develop their skills/ specialization in and/ or a side hustle to earn a little bit of extra money. Now, BITS has an expansive alumni network which you can utilise to the fullest in this regard. BITSians working in full time jobs in the industry will always be willing to provide you a referral/ contact in order for you to land an internship of your choice (subject to exigencies), if you don't already have a personal source yourself that is. This is especially the case if you're seeking an opportunity in CS-IT / Finance / Banking / Data Analytics / Data science / AI / ML and/ or other corporate profiles. All you have to do is look for the right people and hit them up on social media (LinkedIn for example). This is also the case if you manage to track a non BITSian who might be a person of interest to you. The key point here is that you must be willing to pursue the opportunity ruthlessly yourself and not just wait for something to happen on its own. In BITS, there's a kind of no attendance policy which means that you'll have a lot of time for pursuing semi - full time endeavours for creating a strong professional portfolio for yourself. The management will not really mind you going off to work and only turn up for midsem/ endsem exams (called midsems and compre exams in BITS parlance) and other coursework related stuff like lab practicals/ internals/ classroom tests/ submitting assignments etc etc based upon how you plan to balance coursework and internship. If you're a girl, since there are a few extra hostel rules/ obligations that you'll have to adhere to (you'll get a good idea of these once you finish the admission formalities, also, I don't know a lot about those extra rules in the girls hostel myself) you may have to talk to/ get your parents to talk to the hostel authorities to allow you to be absent from the hostel for extended periods of time. Also, after the corona pandemic a lot of companies have also come to integrate a work from home kind of online solution into their ecosystem which could ease up the circumstances for you, but you might nevertheless also have to plan for the logistical aspects of your program like travel / accommodation etc. Regarding this side hustle thing, you could very well hit up some internship/ freelancing avenues online and straight up start going about it, as long as you have the requisite paperwork (Aadhar Card, a PAN Card linked to it, Bank account linked to both of these etc, also these kinds of trades come with their own set of risks, so take an informed decision with regards to the authenticity of the workplace etc). Again, since you’ll have a lot of time to spare, any such ambitions are not entirely untenable while on campus, it all boils down to how well you choose to utilise your time. Mind you, nobody is going to hold your hand through this, you’ll have to figure out your priorities and plans of action yourself. Most people go for such non coursework internships either in summer/ winter vacations after completing their first year ie in the summer vacation after first or third year/ winter vacation in second or third year, or sometime in their final year. Usually, these vacation internships are the more general, unpaid types that do not require much domain knowledge. Those internships that people do in their final year in their non PS 2 and/ or thesis semester are longer, paid internships that might require of you limited skills/ knowledge of the specific domain that you’re interested in working in. In case you don’t already know what PS 2 is, stick around a bit longer, we’ll come to that in a while. As far as the internship culture is concerned, when I was on campus, I did know a few people who had started to do internships right after first year in summer vacation following the second semester. I also know of a few people who landed six month long paid internships in renowned MNCs in the final year in their non PS 2 or thesis/ non thesis semester which they went about doing whilst coming to campus to only attend placements, thesis evaluations or midsem/ compre exams, which was like 3–4 times that semester that too only for about 5–10 days at a stretch. (There’s a little catch for you if you consider doing an internship in the thesis semester. Generally, the thesis guide ie the faculty member under whom you’re doing a thesis would have you stay at the campus to work on the thesis but if you’ve planned things well, you could get yourself a thesis under such a faculty member in such a field that would not quite require you to put a lot of work into it and neither would the faculty member mind you going away to pursue your plans. Again, this is not a given in itself, its largely contingent to the circumstances you find yourself in). There were also a few people that I knew that worked as freelancers or had small startups of their own, some as early as right in the first year (the college had a very pro-active Technology Incubation Centre called TBI that provided required guidance to campus based startups). There were also some people who had demat accounts and earned money by trading in capital markets. Then there were some people who earned money via poker (yes, real online gambling - its legal but I would highly not recommend investing yourself into this). All the years you spend on campus will yield for you what you choose to make of that time. Notwithstanding this, everybody will be busy with their own thing. During my time I don’t quite remember a widespread hyper active internship culture amongst the students but that by no length means that you cannot go about chasing your ambitions; there’s enough space, opportunity, avenues and encouragement to pursue whatever you feel will benefit you in your professional life, you just need to be aware of whatever is happening in the campus around you and keep the right kind of company. You might face a little pestilence here and there, with say, the management or the employer or the faculty, but again, life isn’t without it’s challenges and you’ll have to learn to overcome these some day or the other anyway. Long story short, you can go for an internship as and when you feel the circumstances to be the most pertinent. If you’ve come this far and you already know about the coursework- linked internship module on the campus, which is also called Practice School, you can very well skip the remaining part of the answer. For those of you seeking clarity on the PS program, here’s a somewhat comprehensive encapsulation of its details: All campuses of BITS Pilani have a credit linked internship requirement, ie there are certain number of credits that are attached to internships (which are convertible to a thesis) that is mandatory for you to do in order to be eligible for graduation. This basically means that you have to complete two internships, if you pursue a single degree program, or three internships, if you pursue a dual degree program, during your stint at the college in order to be eligible for graduation. These internships are arranged for by the college and are covered under the Practice School module. For both single and dual degree students, the first internship which is called PS 1, which is of 5 credits is to be completed in the summer vacation following the 4th semester. This internship is generally unpaid and lasts for about 7 weeks. You may choose to not do this internship but that will render you ineligible for PS 2 and you will then have to do a thesis instead in order to fulfill your graduation requirements. PS 2 is of 20 credits, is to be done in the final year, lasts about 6 months and is generally a paid internship. If you are a single degree student, you will have finished all the compulsory courses by the end of the sixth semester and will end up having to complete only a few electives (usually only 2–3 courses) over the non PS 2 semester, in which you’d sit for placements. If you have planned things your courses well, you can very well complete all required courses and electives by the end of third year itself, go for PS 2 in the seventh semester and graduated in three and a half instead of four years( yes, you can do that in BITS), provided you don’t wish to sit for placements. Now there’s no hard and fast rule that you cannot sit for placements in the PS 2 semester, even if you plan to graduate in 7 semesters; the management does allow you to sit for certain companies/ portfolios during your PS 2 semester. If you have not gone for PS 1, you are ineligible for PS 2 and must do a 9 or 16 credit thesis in order to be eligible for graduation. If you have completed PS 1 and are not interested in going for an internship, you can also choose to not go for PS 2 and do a 9 or 16 credit thesis instead. You will not have any classes/ courses and you will not be staying at the campus during PS 2 (though you might have to stay on campus if you do a thesis, also, you can avail of an off campus thesis where you needn't stay on the campus). You could also graduate by doing a 9 credit thesis instead of a whole 16 credit thesis (you can opt for a 9 credit thesis if you want to finish your elective courses and thesis in the same semester and graduate in 7 semesters). You cannot take any courses simultaneously with the 20 credit PS 2 or the 16 credit thesis. If you’re a dual degree student, you’ll have completed all the compulsory courses by the end of the forth year and will only have a few electives that you’ll have to complete in the fifth year, which you’ll have to do along with a thesis in either the ninth or the tenth semester and go for PS 2 in the other semester of the final (fifth) year. If you’ve planned your courses well, you can finish all compulsory and elective courses by the end of the fourth year and go for two PS 2 internships in the final year, one in each semester, or an year long PS 2 internship In the same company (which is of 40 credits). You can also sit for certain placements on campus, even if you’re doing a double PS 2 or an year long PS 2 . Mind you, only dual degree students get to do this year long PS 2. If you have not gone for PS 1, you are ineligible for PS 2 and must do one thesis in each semester or an year long thesis in order to be eligible for graduation ( this yearlong thesis can either be of 9+16=25 credits or 16+16=32 credits ) or go for PS 2 in one semester and do a thesis (on campus or off campus) in another whilst sitting for placements in the thesis semester (provided you’re doing an on campus thesis, you’ll be allowed to sit for certain placements even if you’re doing an off campus thesis or PS 2). If you have any elective courses left to finish in the final year, you’ll have to do those along with a 9 credit thesis in one of the two semesters and do a 16 credit thesis or go for PS 2 in the other semester, depending upon your situation. You simply won’t be able to graduate in less than 10 semesters if you’re a dual degree student, unlike single degree students who have an option of graduating in 7 semesters. Both PS 1 and PS 2 are arranged for/ allotted by the campus management. They use a certain algorithm based roster method to allot you the company/ internship that takes into account your CGPA and the order of the preference list of companies that you will be required to fill when the allotment process begins in 4th semester for PS 1 and 6th/ 7th semester for single degree students or 8th/ 9th semester for dual degree students for PS 2. (This roster based allotment has a lot more variables that it considers while allotting an internship, so you might end up with something you might not have wanted). As I’ve already stated in the beginning, this PS module has contributed substantively in creating a decent placement record for BITS Hyderabad and all BITS campuses in general. I’ll leave it to you to figure out finer things like caveats of no attendance policy, the credits system, compulsory and elective courses, on campus/ off campus thesis and finishing all courses by the end of the pre-final year; for if and when you join the college (Also, the official name of BITS Hyderabad is BITS Pilani Hyderabad Campus or BPHC for short and somehow referring BPHC as BITS Hyderabad will not sit well with anyone on the campus, so you might want to get used to taking the name we like to hear. I know this is just a pet peeve of ours; but let the proclivity be, just for the sake of it). This has been a very long answer as such and the longest answer I’ve ever written, so if you’ve had the patience to read the entire answer, I’ll be quite impressed and grateful. The one thing I would like to state, at the very end of the answer, is that it’ll bode well for you to plan your career well, since the time you spend in college will be the most opportune that you’ll ever get. That doesn’t quite mean that college is just a tasteless phase full of hectic hustle-bustle. There’s a lot to look out for and a lot to enjoy. All it takes to realise the best out of your circumstances is a dint of thoughtfulness. All in all, rest assured, college is going to be fun.

I graduated from BITS with around 7.8 CGPA, so I assume I’m qualified to answer this question. I’d answer this from a placement point of view. As far as I know the BITS grading system is strict compared to other premier institutes.

I graduated from BITS with around 7.8 CGPA, so I assume I’m qualified to answer this question. I’d answer this from a placement point of view. As far as I know the BITS grading system is strict compared to other premier institutes. For on-campus placements: Many core companies have a CGPA cutoff of 7 and there will be a couple of companies that have higher CGPA cutoff. Most of the time, the placement department tries to convince the company to reduce the cutoff. If it’s not possible, you can request the placement officer to allow you for the written test and it might work depending on other factors as well. For off campus placements: Most of the companies do have a CGPA cutoff as a part of shortlisting criteria. It might be 7/7.5/8 CGPA, because they don’t have much information about the candidate’s capability to work except the college and CGPA. In that case a CGPA of 8 and above can be termed as a safe bet. Try to improve the CGPA in the final semester and it should be sufficient. If it’s your dream company and you want a chance, you can ask any of your seniors to speak to the hiring manager and the HR and convince the, but the general chances are really less. Hope the answer helps! ",0.1999263157894737,Positive,3.3998526315789475,0.017543859649122806,0,3.3998526315789475

There are no reservations of any kind besides a very small handful of seats – in limited streams – for students from certain schools in Pilani and children of employees at the Birla Education Trust. At the orientation, the administrator was positively ecstatic while describing how everyone present there deserved to be there; everyone seemed to agree that casteism had no place within a campus like ours. And to some extent, he was right: in my four years as a Dalit at BITS, I never faced any outright casteism. Instead, what I experienced was a variety of moments – big and small – of institutionalised casteism. The atmosphere at BITS has been designed to encourage students to think beyond caste since we were all there based on “merit”. It convinced us that those who didn’t get in were not good enough. However, it also ensures that we don’t critique the very idea of “merit” which, according to me, is flawed in a system that debars numerous entrants from even applying. BITS’ high fee, computer-based entrance exam and lack of reservations exclude a majority of potential SC, ST, and OBC candidates without ever having to identify them as such. This has created a relatively homogenous population of predominantly upper-class and upper-caste students who, by virtue of their relative homogeneity, would not need to engage with the reality of caste in college and society. The college’s system thus ensures that we carry forward all the worst assumptions that society has about reservations and reserved category students: their capabilities, backgrounds, and so on. It creates an environment wherein we are made to believe that casteism doesn’t exist and we are discouraged from questioning our own complicity. It was an environment in which I could never have openly discussed my Dalit identity. I was isolated by virtue of a lack of other Dalit students. I was always in the minority in any discussion that centred around societal issues of caste and reservation. I was never comfortable enough to disclose who I was because of the constant narrative – both complicit and implied – shared by so many of my peers that assumed that my Dalit and lower-caste batchmates were “not good enough” if they needed reservation to enter spaces that were otherwise closed for them. The first time I was confronted with BITS’ problems with caste was when I was outright asked: “Hey, you’re a Tam Brahm, right?”. It’s a question that seemed innocuous enough the first time, and I simply responded: “No. I’m Tam, but not Brahm.” I used that response the second, third, and fourth time I was asked the same question, and found different ways to avoid answering the follow-up question: “Oh, so then what are you?” By around the tenth time, I just left it at “no”. And at around the twentieth time, I just started asking, “Why would you assume that?” I knew the answer, of course. BITS’ admissions policies unintentionally create a situation where the idea of someone being from Tamil Nadu but not being a Brahmin while still having managed to get admission seemed bizarre; it was an idea that just didn’t register. Non-Brahmin/upper-caste Tamilians were a rarity and Dalit Tamils even more so. This sort of disconnected view of “wait, why aren’t you like us?” would reoccur whenever a certain professor would offer to perform the ceremonial rituals for students who wore their sacred threads, and someone would ask me why I wasn’t coming to get mine done. Another illustrative example of BITS’ problems with caste came in the form of a passing conversation with a close friend. He was describing a recent internship experience. His internship coincided with that of a group of students from another highly-rated public engineering college. While discussing his work, he began to comment on how poorly that other group of students was performing, and mentioned how he wasn’t surprised to find out that they were reserved-category students. It took a moment of silence and some hasty back-tracking for him to clarify what he meant, but the message was fairly clear: it’s safe to assume that if you’re a reserved category student, you’re probably going to be substandard at your work. These sort of casual remarks were not infrequent, and made me feel better about practicing self preservation by not telling my friends about my background. My final example of BITS’ problems with caste comes from a long, heated discussion I had with some of my closest friends in that confusing period just after the CAT results had been announced. We discussed the results of people we knew, and who we thought would clear the perceived interview-call cut-offs for “GEM” candidates (General Engineering Males). The conversation inevitably veered towards reservation, and how “unlucky” they were not to be eligible for lower cut-offs. From there, the discussion shifted to verbal attacks on all those “rich” Dalits/OBCs/STs that they knew who would be abusing the system. What was never discussed was why there were so few candidates from marginalised communities that were applying (which was the real cause for such low cut-offs). The conversation never dwelled on how those sole exceptional cases of “abuse” that they had heard of tended to be distorted or outright false second, third, or fourth-hand accounts. We never talked about how the relatively rare true cases were less in the nature of abuse by rich Dalits and more in the nature of a second-generation reservation beneficiary being one of the few success cases in their community. The unspoken thought I always had was: these people feel this way about an imagined other, so how would they feel about me? None of these are the sort of examples that one would think of as obviously casteist. No slurs were cast, no atrocities committed; there was no incident that would make the news. But what they added up to was a system that perpetuates institutionalised casteism. The system brought in an overwhelming majority of upper castes and communities (I don’t recall meeting a single other Dalit in my course or batch), which meant that in class discussions and in the design of school policies, other perspectives were less likely to come up. The system taught us to look down on people who needed reservation to access education and jobs, which by proxy meant looking down on the communities themselves. The system taught us to assume that people who used reservations were by default worse students/employees, which by proxy meant that people from such communities were by default worse students/employees. The system basically allowed us to pretend that caste didn’t exist, and thus locked us into our rolls as agents in the propagation of casteism. I’ve often wondered since I graduated what could have helped the college shed its inadvertent casteism. I’ve found myself comparing BITS to the university I attended afterwards, where I’ve felt so much better about my identity and my safety. What was different? What could BITs have done better? The reality is, it wouldn’t have required all that much. So long as BITS maintains its aversion to reservation, a lack of representation will always exist. At the very least though, the provision of more SC/ST/OBC-focused scholarships from the University’s side could at least mitigate the cost-aspect that prevents them from applying. The campus already offers a number of merit-cum-needs and other Scholarships, so a targeted approach wouldn’t have been such a stretch. I feel so much better now simply because there are more people like me. Representation matters, and this could help BITS’ demographic issues. BITS has a great system of providing optional courses, and some of my favourite optional courses came from the Humanities Department. Courses like Modern Political Concepts and Gandhian Thoughts already lay a great foundation for subaltern thinking, but an explicit course on Ambedkarite Philosophy could help immensely. The exposure I’ve gained in my new university to broader ways of thinking have helped me immensely, and the roots of such an exposure already exist for BITS to nourish. One of BITS’ biggest USPs has always been its student-driven approach to college life, but student activism was always limited to specific issues within the campus. There were very few active student groups that focused on discussing the larger world outside or on engaging with societal issues. Student activism is a controversial topic and engineering students often feel like they shouldn’t get involved, but BITS has a history of students speaking out. The college was shut down at times in the 70s and 80s. We’ve seen pictures of mass student agitations from the earliest batches. Even in the current decade has seen multiple movements centred around campus issues like mess food, fee hikes and women’s curfew timings. That energy, directed toward issues like caste, could be transformative. Ultimately, BITS was never the worst place in which to exist as a Dalit. Most of the casteism I experienced came from ignorance, not from malice. Some of the people I met there are now my closest friends and allies, people I now feel comfortable enough with to discuss my Dalit identity. In many other ways, BITS has been great in responding to the pulls of society. But like all other institutions, there’s just so much room left for growth.

No debate on this.If you want to try public service examination or MBA or normal job, IIT and BITS and NIT are same.After first job, only requirement you will see mostly while changing job is you should be from Tier 1 college (IIT/BITS/NIT) and you should be good at whatever shit they want you to hire for. Its reality sooner you accept better.In corporate world, a good recruiter will always prioritize what have learnt and what you know as a skill than where you studied from with what grade.Simply put - Your experience matters more than ‘past’ talent after first 2yrs in corporate world.Alumni NetworkCan’t comment exactly on IITs but BITS has a really really good alumnus network.You will know how much it matters in future.The Fun part - What you aim to get from collegeBITS is autonomous - auto means self and nomous means rulesIn other words, everything is handled by the students for the students- be it hostels or mess or student council & rules and all you can think of. If you are an introvert or even an ambivert, BITS will give you a chance to change your life if you want to.BITS will nourish the leadership qualities. You can check out who founded startups like swiggy, redbus, zivame, daily ninja, revv, slicepay etc etc.No one will force you to study or attend classes in BITS. But that has its own advantages and can’t be taken in negative way. If I ask you what role does breaks play in the car? Some will say help to stop the car. But would anyone drive the car at 100mph if there were no breaks? Read again if you don’t get this.That being said, I wish you all the best and hope you get what you are looking for.

Also note that during my last semester , the fees + others expenses amount exceeded my loan balance. Imagine I have already used up 3.5 lakhs and the next bill came as 70 thousand. I was asked to put in the remaining 20 thousand into my loan account and bank made the payment. So you might also run out of loan balance in last semesters if you keep adding addition expenses. Personally after paying back my loan at an intrest rate above 10 percentage these days ,I wish I could go back and cancel couple of those mess signings for hoodies. So if possible try to keep the loan amount to minimum as you will be repaying the loan at a higher rate. In simple words a Rs 1000 jacket to buy will paid back as Rs 1200 calculating intrest and repayment period of couple of years.

Let's analyse your question. The fact that you scored two digit marks in JEE mains clearly shows that you are not strong in your concepts, so I would suggest you to revise your notes thoroughly, as of now. Revise, read the theory, do those old problems which you previously solved again. Doing that will provide you all the confidence you need. Remember one thing, if you are solving papers with being thorough without your concepts it won't help. I will suggest you to take one test each at the end of the week and the rest of the time should be utilised on revising. I would suggest you to study for JEE Mains. Don't worry much about BITSAT much if you prepare well for your JEE you will ace BITSAT easily. But remember BITSAT have more questions in Maths than in Physics and Chemistry and also has logical reasoning and English question. So just keep that in mind too. Also to be more realistic (considering you got 2 digit marks in JEE mains Jan) I would suggest you to give other exams such as VITEE, MET, SRM JEE and do prepare well for these exams too. Don't worry about the past. Concrete on your present and define your future. Don't lose hope. Good luck ",0.14934375,Positive,3.2986874999999998,0.017543859649122806,0,3.2986874999999998

Coming to the differences. If you choose to take a course that is not related to your discipline or which does not come under your branches discipline electives, say you are a student in electronics and decide to take business and valuation course, then this will count as an open elective. If you have finished with your 3 required humanities electives and decide to do a 4th humanities elective then this will instead count as an open elective. Getting the electives you want will depend on your PR no and if you have a bad PR, the leniency of your registration department. ",-0.1242,Negative,2.7516,0.011695906432748537,0,2.7516

Remember all 4 of these are excellent colleges.All belong to tier 1 category. Placement wise-IIIT H>=Bits Pilani>Nit Trichy>DTU. Placement wise all 4 colleges are great.IIIT Hyderabad is great for CS with last year avg for CS being around 25LPA.Bits Pilani isn't much behind with avg CS Package of 24.45 LPA for 2018-19.Nit Trichy and DTU had avg CS Packages of around 18 LPA.Overall College median(including all branches) of Bits Pilani(13.89) is better than DTU(11.17) and Nit Trichy(9.2).IIIT H have 2 branches only CS and ECE that's why it's overall college median is 20+ LPA. College Life-DTU>Bits Pilani>Nit Trichy>IIIT Hyderabad DTU wins here due to Delhi perks.IIITH have a strict curriculum leading to it being on Last. Flexibility-Bits Pilani>>DTU>=Nit Trichy>IIIT Hyderabad Bits P wins easily here due to 0% attendence,own timtable,freedom to choose professor of ur choice and unique dual degree system. Fees-Nit Trichy>DTU>IIIT Hyderabad>Bits Pilani If financial conditions aren't very strong then Nit Trichy and DTU are great options.4 years Btech can be completed within 10–12 Lakhs here.IIIT Hyderabad isnt very expensive either(12–14 LPA).These 3 colleges are excellent value for money.Bits P on the other side being a private college is becoming very expensive these days(4 year fees 18–20L). Fees is biggest disadvantage for Bits.Ive seen many guys scoring 390+ in Bitsat didn't join Bits due to the fee factor:( But again,if financial conditions are strong never hesitate in joining colleges like Bits Pilani.Belive me it's totally worth it.The opportunities that one gets in Bits are much more than any other private college in India. Brand Value-Bits Pilani>=Nit Trichy>IIIT H>DTU I don't have any numbers to prove it but this out of my personal experience. Peer Quality-IIIT Hyderabad>Bits Pilani>Nit Trichy>DTU Nit Trichy and DTU are placed towards last due to reservations. I tried to be as unbiased as possible.

The main motto of BITS is to provide the learning opportunity and the precious education to the victims who are unfortunate to get a seat in NIT and IIT because of the caste reservations. Despite any ranking BITS is the number one private institution in India To be a bit clear about ranking.  Source: I got this from the BITS institution mail. Sent to us.

Selecting the right Institution to join, after 12th class is one of the most daunting tasks, parents and aspirants weigh in several different opinions and statistics before selecting an institute.One of the most recurring questions raised by many Aspirants is ""Why is BITS lagging behind in NIRF Ranking ?""I would like to take this opportunity to clear out several misconceptions regarding the ranking and give everyone a general overview of the framework. No University can be ranked perfectly using a fixed set of rules and NIRF ranking by no means is an exception. Many senior academicians have voiced their concern on the vital flaws the current ranking system suffers from, yet many of them have not resolved yet. Also, don’t get we wrong but it is a fact that Central Govt. wants government institutions like IITs and NITs to top the list. The value and prestige of a BITS degree are well known to recruiters and foreign universities. It is one of the oldest engineering institutes in the country founded in 1956. The alumni network is incredible and the largest among Indian universities. Being a student who cleared JEE and BITSAT both with a decent rank, I can surely say that BITS Pilani is as par with the old 6 IITs. The campus culture, quality of students, and institutes image are top-notch. This is not just a defending post as BITS doesn’t need NIRF ranking to prove, students from here are getting a number of MS admits from Stanford, MIT, Harvard, Cornell, Upenn, UC Berkley, and all other top universities in the world. I myself interacted with my seniors who themselves achieved these marks. The core placement of BITS Pilani is the top in the nation and if you know how much core placements mean to a college, you know the difference. You can check out LinkedIn profiles of BITSians and decide how they are leading the industries. Not just BITS, one of the most preferred institute for Computer Sciences in the country “ IIIT Hyderabad “ is ranked 43. You can check others too. This post will be discussing some of the major Points considered in NIRF and how they affect the rankings. NIRF (National Institute Ranking Framework) rankings of the HRD Ministry, track 5 major parameters namely: Teaching Learning & Resources, Research, and Professional Practice, Graduation Outcomes, Outreach, and Inclusivity and Perception. Ranking of all the higher education institutes has been made keeping the same yardsticks in mind. The NIRF document clearly says that ""Responsibility for the accuracy and authenticity of the data lies with the concerned institution."" This means no data has been cross-checked by NIRF officials. 1) Teaching, Learning & Resource In order to arrive at a numerical value about learning at the institutions, the framework refuses to devise any organic tool to measure how well the teachers are teaching or how well the students are learning. It instead naively uses available crude statics of student strength, student-faculty ratio, number of faculties with PhDs, and the total budget of the institution to make sweeping statements. To understand how deceiving this can be, you must know that 7 of the top 10 universities in this matrix are either medical institutions or agricultural universities. The hollowness of the measurement is hidden in the aggregate rankings, where these institutions are not even in the top 50. 2) Research and Professional Practice The next parameter is a globally contested one – Research and Professional Practice. The inclusion of the number of publications and citations are baby steps towards the infamous problem of western universities — the demise of teaching. Experts are beginning to remind the world that the primary purpose of a university is to help students learn; research is only secondary. There is a thriving system of predator journals in India, which are taking advantage of this system. To further elaborate here is an extract from a news report : "" India has the dubious distinction of being home to 42% of fake single-journal publishers."" For those who have little idea about predatory journals, they are fake journal companies that publish anything you right without a proper peer-review process for money, such research is not recognized by any foreign University or Society. Predator/un-indexed journals have been blacklisted by the UGC, yet their publications are being counted for the assessment of a university's rank. 3)Perception Don’t be surprised how there’s actually a criterion called ‘perception’. It is said to be based on online surveys to understand what perception employers, academia and public have of an institution. 4)Outreach and Inclusivity There are factors like the number of economically and socially backward students, Women in the program, the number of students from other states, etc. These are factors that would alienate the talent and increase reservations in important categories. No or Very little importance is accorded to factors like 'recency of curriculum', 'importance to industry-relevant courses', 'student performance in competitions', 'fostering social inclusion programs at the campus', 'alumni effect', 'historical trend of performance of alumni' etc. 5)Graduation Outcomes The Metric for Placements only looks at the percentage of graduating students placed and doesn't bother much about the quality of placements. Mass recruiting companies that mainly visit lower-tier colleges give them a huge boost in ranking. example:- TCS recruits a large number of students from lower-tier colleges on a low pay scale. ::Conclusion:: The highest weight is given to parameters like Peer rating, Citations, Publications, Quantitative figures for Faculty experience - These parameters look good on paper however when put to test they fail because a more academic bent to faculty would lead to a more myopic approach to teaching. Faculties with adequate industry experience should be given much more importance. Also, the fundamental issue with coming up with weighted rankings is the question of weights. Weights are an indication of priority – but whose priority? Currently, the NIRF has decided that research performance counts towards 30% of a university’s rank and 20% of a college’s rank. Does the average undergraduate student really value research to that extent? No; also the quality of research is never questioned upon only the quantity is measured. This is a driving factor in leading India to be one of the top nations in ""fake research.” PS:- I borrowed a major part of the answer from my senior “ Jai Krishna” ( BPHC) ",0.13436415094339627,Positive,3.2687283018867923,0.04678362573099415,1,4.268728301886792

I was never aspiring for IITs, I was from small town and coaching institutes here are not that good and I was not allowed by my parents to go to Kota for coaching. My sole aim was to get BITS(any campus) or top NITs or IIITs. I was getting NIT Patna EEE in the 7th round of JOSAA. I also appeared for VITEEE and got a rank of 2.3K. I don't know if that was sufficient for getting CSE at Vellore campus or not as I did not apply for its councelling. I scored 272 marks in BITSAT. I applied for councelling. I was getting MSc. Bio in Pilani campus. Although I was not aware of dual degree program of BITS but after consulting with seniors I made my mind to take admission at BITS. After coming to college I was surprised by the environment. Students were pretty serious about their future. They were not only focusing on grades but also involved in many kind of development activities. Some of them were involved in competitive coding, application development and web development from first year itself. Some of them had started preparation for UPSC and other competitive exams. Many of them wanted to pursue higher education from foreign universities. Many students were involved in different kinds of sports. Almost all of the students were into some kind of club or department. I don't know about the quality of students at VIT but I can safely say that the quality of students at any campus of BITS is very high. Regarding infrastructure and facilities, I can surely say that it is one of the best according to me. Our hostels, lecture halls, academic building, library are fully equipped with high speed internet. Students get 5GB data per day. Although we can access unlimited fast internet at IPC labs which are open till midnight. Professors here are good. I will not say great except few. They are very interactive. In hostels, there is no curfew timing. You can roam around the campus even at 2 A.M. Mess food is good. Hostel rooms are also fully equipped. Regarding placements it is better to say nothing. Anyday placement at any campus of BITS is much much better than VIT Vellore. Regarding research I don't know much about it. Getting into VIT is very easy. One of my classmates at my coaching had scored just 26 percentile in JEE Mains and is now student of Mechanical Engineering at VIT Vellore Campus. Although I am not generalizing this point for every student at VIT. The only negative factor at BITS is its high fee. Deep down inside we all know that if every student at VIT is given a chance to join BITS they will surely join BITS. Although many of them will not accept it on Quora. I don't know how much fair is the NIRF ranking but I can safely say that if it is fair with not bribery involved then it's a matter of time for BITS to overtake VIT. .

Hence,never choose a college solely on rankings.Rankings can be misleading as I just mentioned.Do, research yourself and check for factors like placements, alumni network,brand etc. ",0.4476500000000001,Positive,3.8953,0.023391812865497075,1,4.895300000000001

Now don't get me wrong, SNU's B.Sc. (Research) program isn't intolerable. Based on my personal experience here though, I feel that the physics course has a lot of issues. Allow me to draw up a comparision in order to explain: Pedagogy: By far, this is the most important thing that a department and a University on the whole needs to sort out.BITS Pilani has a long established history, with faculty specialising in various different areas and from what I've heard, their ability to teach is pretty decent.SNU however, has a major chunk of its physics faculty devoted to material science. More importantly though, while they're all perhaps excellent researchers, not many of them seem to take their teaching seriously.From a personal experience, one of our professors in my first electrodynamics course (which was in my second semester, ie, I was still a fresher) opened up a lecture saying, “You'll all gradually lose interest in physics.” Who wants to be taught in a place where some faculty speaks like this, regardless of the intent?On top of this there are people who teach important courses with no regard for the fact that they're blabbering nonsense. Most of our professors tend to plagiarise course materials (that happens in many other places too I'm afraid). One of our professors plagiarised Feynman's Lectures Volume 3 for an Introductory Quantum Mechanics course. He presented slideshows with close to no essential content (or math, which is quite important in this topic) and included many incorrect and incomplete explanations to phenomena that are otherwise quite well explained from the source that it was plagiarised from.While there are such nuisances everywhere, I trust that the situation is a bit better in BITS, considering what I've heard from students from BITS. SNU's physics department has its share of excellent professors as well, but two or three out of thirteen isn't improving their chances.However, there are some genuinely great professors in SNU, hardly around 5, who may or may not take courses of great importance depending on the whims and fancies of the powerful ones. While one or two might be a little behind as for struggling in communication, they know their stuff well, are humble enough to see their mistakes and are good people as well.SNU also seems a bit short on manpower in the physics department, or so has been told to us repeatedly. Some problems such as lack of courses in various important topics (Fluid Dynamics, Optics, Elastodynamics, etc.) come around in this form. Kindly do not trust the prospectus that's typically shared when it comes to electives. Hardly 5–7 of them have ever been offered.In contrast there appears to be a wide range to choose from in BITS, but I do not know enough to say whether it is a farce such as SNU's physics elective list or if it is genuine.Research: Now, from a point of view of opportunities, I believe SNU has an edge here, but that's about it.The course structure in SNU has nothing at all that aims to prepare you for actual research, unlike BITS, which has mandatory courses for writing technical reports and courses involving literature survey as well.The faculty of physics in BITS specialize in several different areas, and it is not as focused as SNU is on material science. This increases options for a student who's otherwise clueless and there are more chances that a student with a passion can work on it.One good thing about SNU is the Opportunities for Undergraduate Research program which is rather unique and sets it apart from many other reputed institutes.The final thing I'd like to point out is not something I can compare with BITS having not seen the situation myself, that is, the matter of authority. While SNU authorities themselves can be quite difficult, most of the facuty of physics are a class apart. Difficulties with authority can occur anywhere and everywhere, but unfortunately, from what I've observed, it's strangely difficult to deal with in this department at SNU. Frankly, since this is a public answer, I'll admit I've never faced any particular difficulty in person, and I've only observed them being unreasonably stupid in some delicate cases.The first and last department get together that we had, the person with most power in the department happened to say something passively racist to introduce one of our better professors who ultimately left SNU in 2018.People holding positions to offer counsel end up refusing to help rather than be unable to more often than not.The worst thing that could happen in an academic environment is a professor holding personal biases, mocking students during important presentations, etc, while also grading the person for the same. This is a common occurrence for some of our faculty.Let me also add the fact that some people in power intentionally make graduation difficult for some people, particularly those who change their major and those who go for exchange programs.I know there's probably quite a bit of personal bias in my answer here, but it isn't just me, for I've not been affected by these problems as much as some others. A lot of my peers, juniors and seniors have regretted coming to this place. Funnily enough, many have lost interest in physics. Many are struggling with it even though they still like physics due to the lack of teaching ability, after all, not everyone is quite able by themselves until a certain point. Fun fact: Around 4–5 SNU physics freshers this year have decided on switching their major from physics. This is a testament to the problems with mainly the lack of focus on pedagogy. If you're serious about learning and just want to breeze past this phase of life unconcerned about the difficulties, then you might go to either place really. From my experience though, I'd sincerely recommend any place that is not SNU for physics. SNU is a pretty decent University otherwise. To be honest, these problems are a reflection of a more fundamental problem with education in India in the broader context. And similar or worse issues exist everywhere in the country, even in the most reputed institutes. I personally hope that the department that's given so much trouble to so many of its students redeems itself somehow, by overcoming the petty politics and focusing on the students they're responsible for nurturing. However, based on what I know and have seen from the people in charge, this wouldn't happen unless some drastic steps are taken. PS: I've heard BITS Goa to be a far better option for physics than Pilani. Choose wisely :) ",0.13660250000000002,Positive,3.273205,0.0,0,3.273205

Admission: CEG has fixed cutoff scores based on the state and other board marks of that particular year. The admission process for BITS Pilani is merit based. To get into BITS, you are expected to have a minimum of 75% PCM aggregate in board exams to appear for the admission process and further score well in a separate entrance examination called BITSAT. As you can see, the qualifying requirements for both are challenging in their own ways. 2. Brand: Both institutions are known for their prestigious brand value both nationwide and abroad; CEG’s fame and reputation has been maintained due to its archaic appeal, and BITS Pilani is known to be in the same level as premier IIT institutions in India. 3. Infrastructure: While it is undeniable that CEG, Chennai has a huge campus with facilities like swimming pool, gym, library, banks, playground, canteens and stores sprawling over 223 acres, it is no match for the BITS campus which is almost 4 times as big, and is endowed with far more amenities, ranging from air conditioned classrooms, wider gaming arenas, on-campus restaurants, all night canteens and so much more. Which brings us to the fee structure. 4. Fees: This is one of the most widely touted reasons for giving CEG top priority. The fees are easily manageable, with the total cost of tuition for BE/BTech programmes a little over 1.2 lakhs (additional expenses for hostel accommodation). Concessions for first graduate or low income families are also available, although the fees are hiked for NRI/ other state candidates. In comparison, the annual fee at BITS Pilani ranges from anywhere between 2.5-3 lakhs, so the total cost of education comes to be around 12 lakhs for an equivalent BE course. However, scholarships such as the MCN (Merit cum Need) Scholarship which is entirely dependent on your cgpa are offered by the institution for the benefit of low income families. 5. Syllabus: BITS Pilani has a strong, up to date syllabus. Also, based on the 2015, 2017, 2019 regulations, recent revisions have been made in CEG’s syllabus with a whole lot of updated content that is sure to equip the candidate with sufficient knowledge in their respective fields. 6. University Status: CEG is a public, autonomous college affiliated to Anna University while BITS Pilani is a deemed university. This means there’s flexibility for both institutions to enjoy autonomy over syllabus, correction, placements and research. 7. Freedom: CEG students have a schedule that offers quite a lot of free time that allows them to develop and tend to extra curricular activities. Options available are aplenty for students willing to expand their knowledge. 8. Exposure: Many number of culturals, symposiums and events take place all around the year in both institutions, exposing the students to a wide range of fields and knowledge gained by experience. Kurukshetra, Techofes, Agni are acclaimed college fests in CEG, Chennai. There are also an umpteen number of clubs that you could get involved in to improve your overall personal development. BITS Pilani offers a wide range of activities to inculcate growth and room for learning outside books as well, such as the BITSMUN (one of the best MUNs in the country) APOGEE, BOSM, Oasis, and much more. 9. Placements: The placement rate of CEG is quite good, and it stands at nearly 76-80% every year. Top companies like Infosys, L & T, Caterpillar with average salary starting packages at 4-7 lakh per year ensure good employability of graduates. The highest salary packages offered range from 15 LPA to 17 LPA. This is laudable when taken in context of other colleges solely in TN. When put against BITS, CEG still has a lot of catching up to do. The placement percentage is higher at 91%. This could be attributed to the effort the college takes on behalf of the students by mandating two internships (one at the end of 2nd year for a duration of 2 months and the other for an entire semester in the final year), which gives a huge boost to the student’s resume. From all this, you can surely draw your own conclusions. When it comes to making your own decision, there may be several external factors such as location, fees and choice of course to take into account.

But with the freedom, you get the responsibilities. To remain in the competition, you have to study. May it be by attending classes or by self-study. Credit-based Academics: Every subject or course is marked with some score, known as credits. And every branch has its own credits. Taking a degree in BITS means you have to complete all the credits. For that you can take your own time, may it be 3 years or 5 years. If you complete the credits you will get the degree. There are a lot of advantages you can get in BITS.

For eg: I always wanted to do Aerospace in IITB or maybe Mathematics in IIT-KGP, but I didn't get marks even close to these. As for the question: I would suggest that you avoid MSc Mathematics unless you are very interested to do research or interdisciplinary work with other branches here. Mathematics is one of the most toughest subjects to do. Degree in BITS involves lots of pure math courses that almost everyone (except 5–10 out of 65) don't like. Math grading in BITS Goa is hard with C/C- on Averages. I would recommend that you take Mathematics (not only in BITS but any other college also) only when you know you like it and have done prior research on the courses you are going to do. Can't really comment on Economics since I don't know. I would recommend to take MSc. Biological Sciences in general. It's a very good degree and the department is very good in Goa in terms of research, labs and grading. It's quite underrated - In fact it has the lowest cutoff on BITSAT. All the best!

But at BITS, majority are PhD holders from BITS itself. Infact some IIIT B faculty are former faculty of IITs and IISc.

And again , I repeat it isn't at the JEE level in “any” university, it is much easier if not lengthier. Also most students want placements in specially IT and finance domains , and companies dont want a high CGPA guy since they know they ll probably take up higher studies after few years of job. I know many friends of mine who literally cried after being a 10 pointer after companies rejected them blatantly for this reason. Some had to deliberately perform badly in order to reduce their CGPA before placements. Believe me at Bits Pilani , for which I can talk about, if all students started putting equal efforts , all will get tending to full even if teachers set hard papers and differentiating into different categories of GPA would become extremely hard for the institute.

I did not even try to see what those rankings are for a very simple reason. I look at the source of those rankings, I see its the MHRD, a government organisation. Now I am aware of the general hatred and dissent among the government regarding BITS Pilani. To keep it short and simple, BITS and the government do not see eye to eye. BITS Pilani is like your ‘bad’ child that you want to disown- because he grew up without your love and care, burning in the Sun (quite literally, damn Pilani heat!) to be a strong independent individual, thriving as good as or even better than some of your other kids who grew up under your warm shadow. Now you have to remember no matter what, you will always favour your ‘other’ kids. Especially since the black diamond (I do not want to call my college bad child again and again) still does not listen to you, and thrives by his own rules. Every couple of years, we get to hear stories that UGC has put something or other on hold, sent a notice to BITS regarding this or that. That is how it is. Then there is another factor, which is built into the core of India, corruption. Now I am not saying that XYZ bribed them while MNO did not, but it is fairly certain that one of the institutions here has a history of not giving a damn about politics and such rankings on a broader viewpoint, while the other desperately strategises for it (which is in no way to offend anyone- it’s just good promotion). Bottom line: If you are up for a super environment, where each person has reached by his own hard work and not because his great^1–25 grandparents were treated like shit by some shittier people(cough-: reservation), and you want to be challenged- challenged to get sponsors for your annual fest, eat challenging food, create challenging time table, and get selected through a challenging exam, (I mean okay, I promised not to say anything bad about other colleges but what’s the point of having an examination that only has syllabus till 11th duh? it’s like saying f you, you studied last one year for nothing dog!) then BITS Pilani is for you! Rest is just to instigate an endless inconclusive spat between the students and alumni of two good institutions, named BITS and VIT. And about BITS, in the end, It’s Magic… People: please feel free to comment with good justifiable arguments, any trash talk about either institution will be reported!

Teaching Learching and Resources: In this segment, we have a great edge over them. The infrastructure and the facilities provided are way better in BITS Pilani. It primarily considers the qualification of professors, lab facilities, inventory availability, extra curricular activities etc.Research and Professional Practice : We will discuss this below.Graduation Outcome : In this segment also we are ahead. This is based on the overall graduation percentage. And also, average number of Ph.d students graduating.Outreach and Inclusivity : This is pretty low for either of the institutions because of no reservation policy. This segment focuses on the percentage girl students, percentage of backward classes, percentage of students from other states. We have some edge here because of the foreign students and also due to students from different states.Perception : This is decided on two things - First is the Application to seat ratio. It depends on Number of students applied to a specific course and number of students who offered that course. Second, is the rating which is by Govt funding agencies, institution heads, HR employers, NGO etc.The only area where great difference occurs is “Research and Professional practice”. This depends highly on the number of research articles published and the amount of work being done on research. So, due to their huge strength, they are able to work on many projects. For numbers, if we consider strength of a whole batch in BITS Hyderabad that's equal to 1100 including all single degree and dual degree students whereas in VIT, the strength of CS branch alone is around 800 students. That's where we fall behind. Moreover, research is mainly carried out by M.Tech students. So, basically you as a B.Tech student need not consider this. However, VIT is also one of top universities for engineering but when compared with BITS Pilani it falls behind. PS : If you look at QS world ranking of universities, you cannot find VIT anywhere in top 25. Please correct me if there are any mistakes Thank You..!!!

(My city in Gujarat doesn’t have any big-name coachings like Resonance, Allen, FIITJEE etc.) I had JEE main rank 639, which would have fetched me NIT K/W CSE. I think it needs a special mention that I had the second-best JEE advanced 2016 rank in my district. The best rank was ~1050 that year. (He chose IIT B Aerospace.) I chose BITS Pilani Goa Campus CSE over such core branches in old IITs. Obviously, if one gets the same branch in BITS Pilani (even Pilani campus) and old IITs, he/she will opt for old IITs. However, in my case, it was a branch vs college trade-off, as is the case for most students. I did not care much about the societal perception of an IITian vs BITSian. And the placements of BITS Goa CSE already exceed my expectations. For what it’s worth, the placement stats of most colleges and branches are available online, and one can dig deeper into the difference between choosing BITS Pilani CSE over core branches or MSc in old IITs. Based on the placement stats and the reviews of many seniors, I had taken a firm decision that no matter what, I will take CSE only. I did have a passion for maths (and somewhat science - physics and chemistry) since childhood, but we all know how different school studies and engineering college curriculum are. I did not have any more passion for computer science than mechanical or electrical engineering. All I knew was that computer science has a lot better future prospects than other engineering branches. A very famous wall-street journal article - Why Software Is Eating The World / Why Software Is Eating the World Come on. If most of the JEE toppers are “passionate” for computer science, why should I also not be? :P (No offence intended to anyone.) I had these options:1. Taking a drop for a year to reappear for JEE:Given that I was already getting BITS Pilani Goa campus CSE, I did not want to take the risk of dropping, and putting all 3 of my ranks (JEE main, advanced and BITSAT) into a gamble. I was already happy with BITS Pilani since it was a quite rare occasion in my city. (Very few people from my city get into BITS or IITs.) This would have succeeded only if I would have got a rank in top 1000 in JEE advanced (for old IITs’ CSE), which seemed quite unlikely. Also, the cost of dropping for a year seemed to outweigh the advantages. 2. Taking admission into any branch in an old IIT and trying for a branch change: Come on. This is an even high risk, reward game than the previous one. I knew I will keep working hard in college and will get a high CGPA, but I was afraid of the IITian crowd, and the minuscule number of branch changes allowed every year. One has to get 9.8+ or such CGPA (i.e being in top 4–5 of the whole batch of 1000+ students) for getting a branch change to CSE in an old IIT. It turns out that I had underestimated my capabilities here and got a quite high CGPA (9.6) at end of my first year in BITS Goa, which was enough to get a branch change into CSE in BITS Goa. Lol. Since I was already in BITS Goa CSE, I did not have to change branch again. Perhaps I would have gotten that coveted branch change into CSE at an old IIT, perhaps not. Who knows. 3. Getting into a new IIT or NIT K for CSE: I searched online and concluded that new IITs that I was getting (Mandi or Gandhinagar) had on an average, not as good placements as BITS Goa CSE. Since it’s not relevant to the current question, I will leave it here. Ravishankar Joshi (રવિશંકર જોષી)'s answer to What are the advantages & disadvantages of studying CSE in a new IIT instead of BITS Pilani? Although regarding NIT K, I sometimes feel that I made a mistake and NIT K has actually a better curriculum in CSE compared to BITS Pilani. I was getting IIT Gandhinagar CSE, but that felt too risky since my batch (2016–20) would have been the first CSE batch there. I was getting IIIT H CSD, which I did not take, on which I wrote as a reply to a comment. Overall, I can say that option 1 and 2 were too risky and stressful, and option 3 was decent enough. During my B.E. at BITS Goa in CSE, I received internship offers from D E Shaw and Google India and interned at Google India. Later, I got placed into Uber India, all through campus placements. Hence, I can safely conclude that my decision of choosing BITS Goa CSE over old IIT any branch or new IIT CSE was successful. I obviously understand that there are many pros and cons of each of the paths that I could have taken. But I feel satisfied at the end of the current path and looking forward to the high hopeful future that is lying ahead of me now.

If government forces Pvt institutions to take sub par reserved category students these institutions not only will lose fees but also if these students don't get good jobs after graduating, the college would also loose reputation which will make other students not take admission in college. One solution can be that if reserved category students pass entrance exams and qualify for admission government can pay the 3/4 year fees for the student.

During some academic year, the requirements of VLSI guys are more, while at other times, firmware guys are hired in bulk. So choose your subject as per your interest and develop good grip over it. You need to consider following factors before opting for a loan: Always maintain CGPA above 8.You will need to make sure that your CGPA is above 8. People with CGPA in the range 7–8 also got placed, but some had a really tough time finding a job. Having CGPA greater than 8 ensures that you are eligible to appear in every interview happening in campus. For eg: Cisco prefers candidates with high CGPA (above 8, 8.5) for initial scrutiny. Peer pressure, neck to neck competition.The competition will be tough. During my time, the batch strength of every branch was 15–20 (not more than 20). Recently I’ve heard that they have increased number of seats (confirm this once), so the batch strength has gone up to 25–30 students. So, there will be performance pressure. Some financial backup is always good.Completely relying on loan money may not be a good idea. Fee hike every year is a common scenario in BITS. Make sure you or your family has some financial backup to support you in case things start going in an unplanned manner. Financial planning is of utmost important, so sort your finances first. Have a calculative, rather than an emotional mindset in deciding if you can afford a loan. Also, there might be reduction in recruitments for next 1–2 years due to COVID-19 outbreak.

Apart from this and a few minor features, everything in the 3 bits campuses are the same (academic structure,campus rules etc). But you do get almost 80% at BITS Goa of whatever you get in the “already well known tier 1 colleges”. So in conclusion, I’d say that BITS Goa is just a notch away from being a complete tier-1 college, but can be considered to be tier-1 for all practical purposes. Also, if you wish to see the exact differences between BITS Goa and IIT Bombay to clear a much clear picture, you can refer to this answer of mine: Shubhankar Kumar's answer to What is the difference between IIT and BITS Pilani?

Part-1 : Admission Process: We had an entrance test known as BITS-HD (Higher Degree) and the scores would be displayed immediately after the test completes (similar to BITSAT).The admission to BITS Pilani(any campus) was solely based on the test score.(Recently they have started admitting students based on GATE score as well, I’m unaware of the process, cutoff and stipend for GATE admissions).There was a formality interview based on your SOP(doesn’t affect your admission status). There were separate interviews for the Teaching Assistant posts which was different for different departments. Once you are a TA for any of the lab/department, you’d be given stipend. Three semesters of academic courses and one semester of Practice school is the curriculum for masters students. Part-2 Life at campus: You’d be welcomed by rains/showers once you get to the campus during the end of July. A day or two would be for the orientation, hostel etc. All of the students got a single room.Make sure you take a look at the CDCs and electives offered for your branch by speaking to seniors on campus. After this you’d be asked to fill in the electives for the semester and the classes start from August-1st/2nd. There will 4–5 courses per semester for masters students(CDC and electives), at least two or three of the courses have lab work. In case you want to do an elective which is not a part of your electives list, you can audit the course, attend classes. In some cases, it’s better to speak to the course instructor in advance to know about the scope of the course and decide. This can be done for any number of courses provided you have enough time to attend your classes, labs and assignments. Most of the courses have a lab component and some paper submission component. Though the attendance is not mandatory for classes, a few marks will be there for being proactive in classes, some surprise tests(for a couple of courses) The examination scheme was test-1, test-2, comprehensive exam(for a few courses it was midsem and compre). The percentage of marks allotted to these components, labs and assignments would be discussed by the instructor in charge on the starting day of the course. There will be closed book, open book exams, a few exams where you can get some cheat sheets. The labs will be open for 24X7 a month or two after the semester starts. You’d find yourself spending more time in the lab trying to understand the theory. The course projects might be individual or group ones where you work in groups of maximum three people. The libraries are stocked with reference books, latest tech magazines and previous year papers. You can raise a request for the books you need. You can also join various clubs, workshops depending on your interest. You also get to learn a lot from undergrads in such places. Regarding the labs and assignments, they increase your ability to apply what you learnt in classroom and also encourage to come up with your own problem statement for your course project and make it work. All the software you need for any lab or project will be available on DC. I found all these things quite challenging and hectic for the first couple of months, and I started enjoying them once I got into the flow. The tools are of industry standard and the assignments and practice cases are designed to challenge you and bring out the best. In the second semester of your course irrespective of the discipline, there is a Research Practice course where you can pick up any interesting area of work and work under a professor whose line of work aligns with yours. You can keep working on it even after the semester ends with the professor depending on your experience. Most of them who want to venture into PhD positions do it and opt for thesis in final semester(Explained this in the placements part). Regarding non academic life, you have a lush green campus to explore after the classes complete, the long walks in the campus, maggi and coffee at various joints like IcenSpice, food king and the chitchats before and after labs and classes at monginis, different dosas in the night canteen, birthday treats at 12AM near the library, B-Dome are worth an experience. There are a few fests for tech, general, hostel fests(Waves, Zephyr) which are very much enjoyable. You will always cherish the time spent here. Part-3: Placements:The placements for a masters student start before the third semester ideally in July-August in your second year. Your first year CGPA is considered for cutoff, so it’s better to maintain at least 7.5–8 as various companies have it as the first filtering criteria. Most of the big VLSI companies come down for hiring. A few companies might visit one of the campus and in other campuses the interviews are conducted through telepresence. Most of the companies don’t have any branch criteria, so if you’re good at coding or fintech, you can attend the interviews as well.In July- August 2015, TI, Qualcomm, Grey Orange, Johnson Controls, Mathworks, Intel, a few other startups visited the campus for masters electronics students(Mathworks hires only Masters students). The rest of the companies like ARM, Nvidia, Broadcomm etc had come for the practice school. The practice school is similar to an internship offered by BITS based on your first year CGPA for its students in reputed organisations. By this method, you have a second chance to get placed in your dream company through a Pre Placement Offer(PPO) at the end of your internship. It depends on various factors like your performance, openings in the team. It helps you in getting a real time exposure to your area of interest and the company culture. If you want to move into academia, PhD, postdoc you can opt for thesis instead of Practice School and delve deeper into your area of interest. Aftermath: You will be a part of a great alumni network, build connections and look up to them for any career related advice, get referrals, help out people with your field of expertise, recommendations and startup related guidance.

I have detailed my experience and method below -  This should tell you everything you need to know about what it takes to become a 9 pointer, not in terms of hours as such, but in terms of efforts to be put in.

Placements wise, both Pilani and Goa campuses are awesome (Goa is slightly better). The median packages would be around 20lpa (CTC). If you work diligently to maintain a decent grade and practice lots of coding problems, it’s easy to get placed in a good company. Not sure about Hyderabad campus though.

BITS Pilani is a well recognised university, with a really good CSE course structure, which in all aspects is at par with the IITs. There are many other such universities which too have pretty good course structures. Beyond that, it's largely dependent on you. What did you do in college, apart from taking courses? What motivates you to do an MS at that university? What in CSE interests you the most? And more such questions. There is also the GRE, that you would have to give, and the usual stuff like a statement of purpose, grades, and recommendation letters. A combination of all of this, is what matters. Not just which university you're coming from. Even if you would be coming from the best university in India, but fail to prove yourself in other aspects, you shall be rejected. Hell, even if you were studying in Stanford, and apply to Stanford for an MS, you still may get rejected, if you don't do well in the other factors listed above.

I’d also include a friend’s experience in this answer. During my Masters at BITS: BITS tag helped me in getting a scholarship from SBI for two years (duration of my masters). There is a scholarship scheme for the children of employees studying in prestigious Indian institutes like IIT, BITS Pilani(my mother is a bank manager in SBI).Getting a Windows latest version to install for free with the BITS mail ID(specifically many Microsoft products). You can still access IEEE/ACM digital libraries for latest research papers in your field of interest.We used to get student discounts on the bills in restaurants in Goa and not to mention the travel concessions in trains and bus during semester breaks or festivals.I got an internship directly from BITS based on my CGPA because of which I understood which career suits me and looked out for off campus hiring in respective domain.After Masters: The BITS tag gave me an express entry to alumni network who are very active and guide you when you need them. I had attended several off campus referral hiring drives through the alumni. We do get prompt updates about hiring drives and can ask for recommendation as well. PS: I got an interview with a couple of teams in Google India Hardware(last year with 2.5 years of experience) because of a senior from BITS. All I had to do was ask for a referral.It even helped me when I wanted to move into a new job. It was easier to find out about the openings in various companies and directly ask alumni to give a referral and also put a good work with the hiring team. The hiring managers or recruiters used to give some weightage to my resume due to BITS. It helps in salary negotiations as well.

But all good things come to an end. The authorities eventually caught up with him and he unfortunately had a semester cancelled for disciplinary reasons. At that point, he decided that he needed to turn his life around. After a lot of introspection, he came back fiercely motivated. Within a couple of semesters his CGPA shot up to 8. For people unaware of the CGPA system, achieving this jump is an absolutely herculean task, requiring a perfect A in almost every course. But he didn't stop there. He worked on his coding skills. Ended up being one of the two people in BITS Goa to be offered an internship at Nutanix on Day 1. But wait, there's more. He converted the Nutanix internship to a PPO. It was this stage that I met him, when were part of the same team and ended up winning the Smart India Hackathon. Did it end there? Not at all. He went ahead to intern at Amazon Germany and if that wasn't enough, followed it up with a thesis at MIT.

He took partial drop while he was studying at DTU and secured a good branch here at BITS Pilani. On the very first day, orientation ceremony 1000 people jam-packed in the Birla auditorium. And here comes Mr. Sahoo with his question …..”Sir, I left a seat at IIT Bombay just to come here at BITS Pilani, is my decision worth it because not even my aunt believes in the very idea of private colleges like yours???”. And believe me, we were all stunned on the very first day of our college, thinking if we are at the right spot or not? But believe me, my dear friend BITS Pilani does not belong to those ordinary league of private colleges that exist in India( no. 5 on the list of engineering colleges after the old IIT’s) . Sometimes,I feel like conveying this “ Ki Birla Ji BITS ko Bhi IIT k haatho mai de hi do”, but then I wonder that we are more special as BITS Pilani rather than IIT Pilani if it happens so 2. Now coming back to the second thing,” THE GREAT INDIAN IITian TAG” IITian tag is what I wanted the most in the days when I was preparing for JEE, got selected with a descent rank but had to compromise with the branch if I were to go to an IIT. And that dream ended there itself when I came to know the importance of a good branch in the process of counseling. And believe me, Sahoo’s aunt would have been more satisfied if he would have chosen IIT (branch== even biotech works). Looking at the non-NIRF rankings one can clearly say that BITS is among the top 5 engineering colleges of India. But IITian respect >BITSian respect >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>VITian respect and all other random garbage stuff(I think the number of arrows can be more but you can consider that ). But wrapping up the story in a true sense, look what matters the most is the amount of money you get paid after you get that placement and BITSians are quite good at taking hefty packages. Moreover, the campus culture out here at BITS is better than several IIT’s(better than all the new IIT’s for sure). And the best part is that you can’t blame a BITSian for participation in any sort of discriminatory reservation policies. I hope I was able to answer your query to some extent…….And all thanks to Sahoo and his aunt for making my answer a Lil bit more interesting. Edit 1 : Oh dear, my word. Those colleges which tend to admit every section of the society irrespective of cast and sex are not worth your respect just because of the alignment they show with Indian constitution. ( Courtesy : You know if you know the name of colleges, I am talking about ) A lot of offended guys just crashed onto me in the comment section for pointing towards the garbage section amongst the colleges in India. Dude just chill down, if your college has so much more potential then simply reply to this answer by standing on the podium of some esteemed MNC and shout-out loud in the open, that my XYZ college makes individuals like me, otherwise it’s not worth your arguments. A lot of people would say being a renowned employee or CEO signifies nothing at all, well in the present materialistic era, it does… So stop wasting time on the arguments good for nothing.

Also, it becomes quite challenging in the following years to manage both majors and that is one of the reasons why people don’t even contemplate this, even if they satisfy the requisite criteria for a double major.

Dual degree students are also given a window of around 10-15 days at the start of the second semester where they can sit for on campus placements.Other than that if you wish to sit for a particular company or companies which are coming on campus for placements in between semester then you can take leave from your ps station and can come over to the campus obviously your station should be willing to give you leave since they are paying you. Dual degree students also have an option to take an on campus thesis and then sit for on campus placements which a lot of people do and they do get place.Moreover if you are doing an off campus thesis then you can very well make use of that 10 days window and can sit for placements on campus and then go for your thesis which again a lot of people do. Just to give you some details that ps starts from 4th July for first semester students and on campus placements for first semester starts from first week of August so first semester people generally go for a thesis so that they can sit for placements. If it's an off campus thesis they can attend initial days of placements and then go for their thesis and if it's an on campus thesis then they can attend the complete placement season. PS for the second semester students starts around 6th January and second semester placements starts from last week of December so in the second semester dual degree students generally use their 10-15 day window . This is all possible because on campus placements happen in both the semesters .I have seen most of the people getting jobs either through ps or through on campus placements or through off campus placements.Other than this a lot of people go for higher studies too.

I know people from a simple PCM Hons /PG background in a regular govt university studying in MIT. After spending years in US and having active association with IVY league institutions, I can tell that, beyond SAT/GRE/GMAT score and qualifying degree from India, there are lots of other things that, affects your selection. I would recommend stop relying on BITS or IIT or other college for admission in Ivy League beyond couple of percentage points. The selection criteria in IVY league is more to do with, how well rounded you are in your personality and career outlook, rather standard JEE/GATE style preparations. Start visiting the target university website and participate in the associated community. It will help you to prepare now and get absorbed in the culture later , when you make it to the institution. Most Important, ROI is key to the investment you make in a foreign degree, but trust me that’s least of the worry and Selection Process and later education gives it least priority.

WILP It’s simply a mode of education tailored for working professional, who wants to experience immersive education like a regular course, but cannot afford break-in carrier. From rigor and quality of question /assessment, it will be demanding. Useful is a vague term and depends on, what you call useful. If you mean a campus placement, answer is no as it’s work integrated and has a employer Attached as sponsor. Universities across world donot provide placement for a Company aligned programs. If this mean a Alumni from a premier institution and recognition in the industry, answer is yes. Note : The only flip side, I see with the program is the minimum experience , which should be higher 3–5 year for better industry recognition. Market Value : Its gives you status of a alumni from premier institution, but never forget two things to avoid pit fall No one pays for your alumni after a person is out of the campus.Companies will have there own choices, based on what they feel comfortable ( eg. presumably one of the best institution india, we donot hire due to HR reasons, does not mean, college is bad)With the status of BITS Alumni, Only thing one will get is a chance to create opportunities for himself, which is not available with 99% college of India, but remember value you will create for yourself using Degree and not BITS will create for you. Pros and Cons To me education has only pros, but will try to answer this. Pros Immersive studyAlumni status , which may be better than most other colleges and possibly a upgrade for 99.99% people. ( 1.8 M Engg a year)You do-not need to take a break for studies.Exam and Evaluation scheme are as per global standard and degree is well regarded inline with international credit system for education , work or immigration needs.Reasonable fee for a premier private collegeCons Needs to extensive involvement between due to multiple evaluation components ( approx 6–7 per paper per semester, In a way good)Very few weekends are left for personal purposes, a genuinely employed person will feel stretched.People who compare the program with distance education, will feel bad due to high fee and high commitment to studies. ( people want to study but donot want to give time for it)There are rumors in the market about legitimacy of the degree and can drag you into painful discussions.Most important, Degree/Diploma from a premier institution only qualify a person to better opportunities in life, they do-not guarantee anything more than that.

Thanks for A2A. The answer’s going to be a bit long. Scroll down to the end to get the basic essence and summary. Pl. remember this line, it’s gonna help a lot. Birla Institute of Technology and Science, Pilani or simply BITS Pilani is one of the Institutes of Eminence in India for Engineering and Sciences. As is known, it is the only (and only means ONLY, IIIT-H is different please!!) private institute which holds a reputation for being competent with the old IIT’s. BITS Pilani has 4 campuses, 3 (Pilani, Goa and Hyderabad) in India and 1 in Dubai, UAE. It offers 3 Degree programs to First Degree (undergrad) Students. They are B.E.(Hons), M. Sc. and B. Pharm (for Pharmacy). Coming to exams and admission of students here, BITS gives a test called BITSAT which, as of now, is conducted out of 450 (technically, 486). The paper is held in multiple slots throughout a week or two, and consists of Math, Physics, Chemistry, Mental Ability and English. For students interested in pursuing B. Pharm., instead of Math, they have to take Biology. The marking scheme is +3 and -1 with 162 (150+12) questions to attempt within the time frame of 3 hours. Math section consists of 40 questions, Physics and Chemistry consist of 40 each and the last section is Mental Ability and English which has 25 questions. The remaining 12 questions consist of 4+4+4 questions from Physics, Chemistry and Math which get unlocked only after we have attempted all 150 questions and still have time left (you have an option to either attempt those or leave). Now if you have a decent score(which I guess is a good 265–270+), you have a chance of getting into BITS (of course, the cutoffs for different branches are different and they also vary from campus to campus). Also, a requisite for admission through the first method is to secure a minimum of 75% in Board Examinations. Another way to get admitted to BITS is by being a Board Topper(can be Central or State but Board Topper only). Though this technique is a bit risky, it ensures you your desired branch at your desired campus. As for admitting students, they are most happy to admit good students here given you fulfill the basic admission requirements. Coming to another fact, Yes! BITS Pilani has an insanely high fee structure but it offers Merit and Merit-cum-Need Scholarships. And BITS has a reputation for not giving caste and gender based benefits(which is the best part I like about this institution). P. S.: Remember, in the beginning I had told you to scroll down if you found the text boring!! So, for heaven’s sake, PLEASE go to BITS Website if you didn’t get anything because I tried to put it in the simplest text possible. And if you want a goddamn motivation,go & talk to someone who is in there (IIT’s, NIT’s, BITS and IIIT’s) purely on the basis of merit(bar some certain people, though this statement may sound controversial, I am absolutely not interested in retracting my word!), Stop wasting your time on social media unnecessarily and START STUDYING!! Last point, I am not comparing IIT’s and BITS, JEE Adv, JEE Mains and BITSAT. If the reader is genuinely interested in knowing, Do Not and Do. Not. refer to stupid websites giving biased views. You can talk to any student who is in a reputed league of institutions like IIT’s, NIT’s, BITS and IIIT’s (obviously, once again, on the basis of pure merit).

Reliance Oil, Schlumberger etc) so that the Indian engineering students do not question the viability of such outdated engineering branches being taught in India.

Now coming to your question, a big yes and give me just one reason for not being ragged even after using a simple electric toothbrush in colleges like BITS/IIT. Reason - First of all you must know that more than half the population in these colleges do not brush as they wake up just 2 mins prior to their classes. Of all the remaining some have gone for energy-free solutions and started using neem sticks. Others prepare their own toothpaste using different chemicals in the high-tech labs situated inside their campuses. Other ghots/nerds design their own toothbrush using 3-d printing of tooth stem cells on toothbrush mould so that stem cells will help replace the erstwhile damaged cells. Some prepare pure Ca using metallurgical extraction process and pour it on their teeth so as to protect themselves from adulteration.

If you have completed your engineering, you should go for a job immediately. I personally know many meritorious students who, whether it is preparation for the Common Admission Test (CAT) for an MBA, preparing for the civil services or preparing for the General Aptitude Test in Engineering (GATE) for admission to postgraduate courses in engineering or jobs in public sector companies, did so while they were in full-time employment. I would suggest a few years of employment before you do something on your own. Not only would this be invaluable in terms of experience gained, whether you do an MBA or enrol for the civil services, but this would also enable you to save some money on which you can sustain if the going gets tough. So far as an MBA or IAS is concerned, it would depend entirely on your priorities and liking for various subjects, many of which you may not even have studied so far. Take a hard and practical look at the various subjects which need to be studied both for an MBA and the civil services and then decide. If you are still in a dilemma, you may get in touch with experienced student counsellors. Unless you are very keen on serving the country and its citizens, I would not recommend the IAS, or in fact, any of the civil services. Good luck!

Note- You can also join DRDO, ISRO ,etc through CSE but the number of vacancies relatively are much less than Mechanical. If your priority is a better work-life balance then you should join government sector and there are more number of vacancies in Mechanical engineer posts than Computer science engineering posts. If you have some financial constraints and the high fees of BITs is a burden for you then join NIT TRICHY. Some additional information Both NIT Trichy and BITs Pilani are very good engineering colleges. Both Computer science engineering and Mechanical engineering are not good or bad in themselves. Both have equally good career opportunities with their own advantages and disadvantages. In the end I would like to say that your college and stream just provides you with the big stage to perform.

The laboratories for languages, music and Creative Media along with a rich collection of materials in the BITS Pilani Library are vital elements in the pedagogy of the courses taught here. Many of these are interdisciplinary, and all courses combine rigour with variety in both teaching and learning, which is a legacy bequeathed by a tradition of over five decades. The degree programmes of B.A (General) and M.A in Economics, English, Hindi, History, and Political Science were initiated in 1964 and continued until 1973-4, facilitating a reordering of the internal organizational structure with the formation of cluster groups in Economics, Humanistic Studies, and Languages. The Humanistic Studies group and the Languages group were transformed into independent departments, and remained so until 2012, when the two coalesced into the Department of Humanities and Languages. However, many research projects and taught courses offered by the Department contain elements from the Social Sciences. In recognition of this interdisciplinary character as well as to bring uniformity in nomenclature across the four campuses of the University, the Department was renamed as Department of Humanities and Social Sciences in October 2013.

I was intrigued at this question, I wanted to know the answer to this, and I also wanted to know the reason why MSc. Bio students are generally looked down on for their academics (not by me, but others). I also wanted to see if there was a trend across the years for CS as dual. So I wrote a Python script to find the percentage of the students of every MSc. degree getting CS across years. Here are my findings for the data I had (2014 to 2018 batches in Goa campus). Also, I have considered only those MSC. students who have opted for a B.E. dual degree, so you get a better idea. As you can see, this includes the latest 2018 batch dual degree allotment as well which was released a couple of weeks back.  I was somewhat disappointed by the findings. I was hoping to find a trend, but it turns out that there is not much of a trend. I also found out why MSc. Bio students were looked down on by my seniors (just two and one students got CS in 2015 and 2016 respectively, I sincerely hope that this happened because they were not interested in CS and not because their CGPAs were not enough to cross the cut-off. But speaking from experience of two years in BITS Pilani, most students opt for dual degrees in hopes of getting CS a year later, which is just plain sad). And from basic observation, we see that the best chance of getting CS as the dual is for a MSc. Economics student. With that being said, I would also like to say that this should not affect you or your goal (even if it is getting CS). Work hard, get what you want. Anyone with the right determination and a decent work ethic can easily make it. Here are my suggestions to any student thinking of becoming a dualite.

BITS Goa and BITS Hyderabad are not separate institutes. Pilani, Goa and Hyderabad are Indian campuses of BITS Pilani University. Thus, when you graduate from any of the campuses, you get a degree from BITS Pilani. All campuses of BITS are equivalent (unlike old and new IITs). BITS authorities have taken lots of efforts to ensure this. The way that every campus functions with respect to academics, clubs, sports, etc. is very similar. Here is a detailed comparision between NIT Trichy (the best NIT) and BITS-G/H. Placements - Core placements in top NITs are slightly better than BITS whereas BITS has top notch CS/IT placements. However, many private companies come to BITS because of it's course structure. IT placements in BITS are comparable to IITs, so they are better than NITT.Entrepreneurship and start-up Culture - This is excellent in BITS. We have seen lots of start-ups growing to great companies like Hotmail, Onida, Swiggi, etc. The list is endless. Hence, comparable to top IITs.Almuni Support - BITS is one of the most successful universities in India with respect to it's Alumni. They are at top postitions of the world. You can receive great support if you connect with them. Doesn't mean NIT Trichy is bad. It's just that BITS Pilani has been competing with the IITs since 1964. And no, we don't differentiate between campuses in our Alumni group.Peer group will definitely be better in Goa/Hyderabad than NIT Trichy because of no reservation. NIT Trichy meanwhile has reservation. First state, then caste.As for research/projects, Trichy will be better because of government funds. Like, there shouldn't be any comparison.Infrastructure - BITS Hyderabad has a really good infrastructure. Being built recently, it trimphs Goa and Pilani campuses in my opinion. Everything feels new and nicely designed. Goa and Hyderabad campuses have a new Academic building under construction, which is expected to be functioning by early 2020. NITT has a separate building for each department (like old IITs), but I don't know much about it. So, can't comment.Hostels and mess food - Being privately maintained, BITS has very decent hostels and mess food. It is definitely better than most of the government colleges. I am expecting it to be better than Trichy, unless it is exceptional.Fees - BITS Pilani charges way way more fees than NIT Trichy (like total fees are about twice). So, NITT is much better in this aspect. (Having said that, BITS also offers scholarship, especially to the students who have family income less than 10lpa. It is very easy to get. This year, my batchmates with even 6 CGPA got scholarship of about 15% of tution fees. The merit scholarship is a different story. It requires an exceptionally high CGPA.)Rankings: Trichy is really high on NIRF. But as for international rankings, BITS fares better being below 7 IITs and universities like Jadhavpur, Manipal but above new IITs like Hyderabad and BHU. It also fares in Electronics, CSE and Mechanical, QS subject ranking. (NITT fares in CSE subject ranking but below BITS). In QS CS rankings, it is on the same bracket rank as IIITH. In QS Graduate Employability rankings, BITS ranks better than IIT Kanpur and IISc Banglore. BITS also ranks in THE rankings. So, clearly it has an edge on NITT. Again, Pilani, Goa and Hyderabad campuses are ranked together.Brand value: BITS Pilani has a better brand value in the industry than NIT Trichy. Finally, degree you are gonna be getting is from BITS Pilani. Anyways, I don't really care about this point. What matters more are your technical and other skills.Age - NIT Trichy is an old and established institute. So, this one belongs to NITT. But now, Goa and Hyderabad have completed more than 10 years, and they are also very established as well.Computer Science Culture (This point is only to be considered if you are going for CSE). Just look at the total GSoC selections from Goa. It surpasses all IITs including Bombay and Kharagpur inspite of being recently established. People have participated in prestigious olympiads as well. So, clearly CSE Culture is comparable to top IITs. It is better than Trichy.Flexibility - BITS is known for it's academic flexibility. There are lots of discipline electives to choose from. You can also choose open electives from any department like CSE, Electronics, Mechanical, Humanities, etc. You are even given the option to make your own time table.(that is a bane if you get a lower priority number. Finally seats are limited, so, someone has to suffer.) Here BITS edges out the top NITs.So, this was a comprehensive evaluation. NIT Trichy is very good with respect to Academics/Research (like IIITs/IITs) whereas BITS is known to be more business/entrepreneurship oriented. If you ask me, I would have gone for BITS in your situation (especially for CSE). However, there are some who prefer NIT Trichy, because of lower fees for similar quality of education and good placements for Core branches. You should make your own decision based on factors you give importance to. Both the institutes are really good and one of the best in the country. As for the other NITs, BITS Goa/Hyderabad campuses definitely perform better. There is no doubt there. You should definitely prefer BITS in such a case.

One of the most recurring question raised by many Aspirants is ""Why is BITS lagging behind in NIRF Ranking ?"" I would like to take this opportunity to clear out several misconceptions regarding the ranking and give everyone a general overview of the framework. No University can be ranked perfectly using a fixed set of rules and NIRF ranking by no means is an exception. Many senior academicians have voiced their concern on the vital flaws the current ranking system suffers from, yet many of them have not resolved yet. This post will be discussing some of the major Points considered in NIRF and how they affect the rankings. NIRF (National Institute Ranking Framework) rankings of the HRD Ministry, track 5 major parameters namely: Teaching Learning & Resources, Research, and Professional Practice, Graduation Outcomes, Outreach, and Inclusivity and Perception. Ranking of all the higher education institutes has been made keeping the same yardsticks in mind. The NIRF document clearly says that ""Responsibility for the accuracy and authenticity of the data lies with the concerned institution."" This means no data has been cross-checked by NIRF officials. 1) Teaching, Learning & Resource In order to arrive at a numerical value about learning at the institutions, the framework refuses to devise any organic tool to measure how well the teachers are teaching or how well the students are learning. It instead naively uses available crude statics of student strength, student-faculty ratio, number of faculties with PhDs, and the total budget of the institution to make sweeping statements. To understand how deceiving this can be, you must know that 7 of the top 10 universities in this matrix are either medical institutions or agricultural universities. The hollowness of the measurement is hidden in the aggregate rankings, where these institutions are not even in the top 50. 2) Research and Professional Practice The next parameter is a globally contested one – Research and Professional Practice. The inclusion of the number of publications and citations are baby steps towards the infamous problem of western universities — the demise of teaching. Experts are beginning to remind the world that the primary purpose of a university is to help students learn; research is only secondary. There is a thriving system of predator journals in India, which are taking advantage of this system. To further elaborate here is an extract from a news report : "" India has the dubious distinction of being home to 42% of fake single-journal publishers."" For those who have little idea about predatory journals, they are fake journal companies that publish anything you right without a proper peer-review process for money, such research is not recognized by any foreign University or Society. Predator/un-indexed journals have been blacklisted by the UGC, yet their publications are being counted for the assessment of a university's rank. 3)Perception Don’t be surprised how there’s actually a criterion called ‘perception’. It is said to be based on online surveys to understand what perception employers, academia and public have of an institution. 4)Outreach and Inclusivity There are factors like the number of economically and socially backward students, Women in the program, the number of students from other states, etc. These are factors that would alienate the talent and increase reservations in important categories. No or Very little importance is accorded to factors like 'recency of curriculum', 'importance to industry relevant courses', 'student performance in competitions', 'fostering social inclusion programs at the campus', 'alumni effect', 'historical trend of performance of alumni' etc. 5)Graduation Outcomes The Metric for Placements only looks at the percentage of graduating students placed and doesn't bother much about the quality of placements. Mass recruiting companies that mainly visit lower tier colleges give them a huge boost in ranking. ::Conclusion:: The highest weight is given to parameters like Peer rating, Citations, Publications, Quantitative figures for Faculty experience - These parameters look good on paper however when put to test they fail because a more academic bent to faculty would lead to a more myopic approach to teaching.Faculties with adequate industry experience should be given much more importance. Also, the fundamental issue with coming up with weighted rankings is the question of weights. Weights are an indication of priority – but whose priority? Currently, the NIRF has decided that research performance counts towards 30% of a university’s rank and 20% of a college’s rank. Does the average undergraduate student really value research to that extent? No; also the quality of research is never questioned upon only the quantity is measured. This is a driving factor in leading India to be one of the top nations in ""fake research"". For more information please Google about NIRF.

This means you'll have to pay hostel and mess fee every semester, which is around Rs. 37,000 per semester. You might get 80% scholarship too, but you can't be sure of that because it is given to the top 1% of the MCN applicants. Top 3% get 40% and top 6% get 25% and income slab currently for MCN is 10 LPA. And in Pilani campus, due to high competition chances of 80% at a CG of 8.6 each sem is bit difficult, it generally is around 8.9 in the recent years. Also, you'll get scholarship for the semester you are currently studying in next semester. For example, if you are currently in 1st semester, you'll get the scholarship for it in the second semester. This means first you'll pay and then you'll get back in the next semester. So you'll have to bear the fee of 1 semester entirely by yourself. Now that you have the information about scholarship, let me give you other information which can be helpful. You can avail loan for four years of your education and travel expenses at BITS Pilani. BITS comes in A category of SBI for education loan offers and you can easily get it processed within 4–6 days and interest rate is near about 8.5% per annum. Since BITS has very good placements and other opportunities, if you work accordingly you can pay off your loan within 5 years, many are able to do it within 2 years, though the period is 12 years with 1 year of relaxation period, that is, you can choose not to pay in that 1 year. Now answer for the all expenses part, apart from fee it all depends on you. There are eateries throughout the campus, you'll be spending mainly on outings and fests and that's not much and is very manageable. With 2k per month, you can manage that. Many spend ranging from 1k to as much as they want. So make an informed decision, and I would say don't leave BITS just because of money if you don't have other good options. I am myself availing MCN and taking loan because my family income falls in the MCN slab. ",0.03557419354838709,Neutral,3.071148387096774,0.04678362573099415,1,4.071148387096774

But, if I were to conclude then and there that getting into an IIT was success, I’d have failed to become what I am at this point. I’d have undone everything that got me into an IIT. After all, getting there was only the starting point and not many know it at that time. I’ll let you in on a secret - Not making into IITs is not the mark of failure. The same way not being a CS student is not the end of the world. I have seen so many of my batch-mates, who… Had much better rank than I did.Were way more smarter and intelligent than I was.And yet, I have seen them go down because they lacked an even more important trait - Determination. I often keep telling myself - Life is not a 100m race where you run fast and then stop and expect to win. Life is like a marathon, where you have to keep pushing yourself consistently. And in a marathon, it doesn’t matter who is in front after the first 100m, or the first 500m. What matters most is where you stand when the race is over. I hope you get the flow.

In the second year, there are only two hostels allotted to second yearites that have single rooms. Hostels in first year are allotted randomly but in the second year you get a say in choosing your wing and fill hostel preferences. After that a chit-box poll is conducted with several preferences and then you get the nth preference based on your luck. In higher semesters, it's almost sure that you'll get a single room unless you're unlucky to find yourself in a position where all single rooms are allotted or you get a ‘not so preferable’ hostel.

602,602,Birla-Institute-of-Technology-and-Science-Pilani-Pilani-Campus,What should one be aware of before deciding to take an admission into Birla Institute of Technology and Sciences (BITS) Goa?,6,1,6/1,Yes,Followed,2019-07-20,https://www.quora.com/What-should-one-be-aware-of-before-deciding-to-take-an-admission-into-Birla-Institute-of-Technology-and-Sciences-BITS-Goa,"Before answering your question, I would like to congratulate you for making it into one of the top Engineering and Science institutes in India. Now, coming to the answer. A lot of people enter the Institute with the hopes that their experience at the University would be a breeze. They think that after slogging for 2 (or more in some cases) years that their life is set, and that without any effort in the Institute will yield them good results. Please do not think this way. In fact, your life is only starting now. College is hard. You might have been a topper in your school, but here almost everyone was a topper as well. The competition is intense, and good most of the time. Be ready to put good amount of efforts on academics. When I say that college is hard, I am not just talking about the academics. There is a lot more to college life than academics.Be ready to get uncomfortable. All this while you might have been staying in your comfort zone at home. It might not be entirely possible to live the same way as you were at home. You will figure it out once you get here. This point is not just BITS Pilani, but would apply to all students getting into their under-grad.You will encounter very different sorts of people here. Choose wisely as to what kind of people you want to spend time with and interact on a frequent basis. You will meet people right from the ones who have been burnt out due to JEE coaching and do not want to see a book again in their entire lives, to people who use the Institute as their drug den, to people who have made it their life’s objective to watch all the movies and TV shows that have been made and to do only that, to people who are always working in clubs, to people who only care about their scores in the tests. Of course, there will also be people who might be a combination of some. Its your life, so better decide what you want to do with it.Whether you like it or not, from what I have seen and heard from friends, most of us feel that our teachers were better in school or coaching. Do not come here with the expectations of having amazing teachers for all courses. That being said, there are some amazing profs, just a handful of them though. Its just that he average rating for profs in the university might be lower than what the average rating for a school or coaching might be.Because of the previous point, there is no point in attending all classes for all the courses. Attend all of them at the start of the semester, figure out which ones you can do yourselves without the help of classes and the ones which you cannot do well without a prof’s help. Only attend those classes which you think will help you.The 0% attendance policy at BITS Pilani is mostly a sham. A lot of courses impose a psuedo-attendance component, be it marks for attendance in lectures or tuts, a lab evaluative component (which requires students to attend lectures so as to understand what one must do in that lab), etc.The 0% attendance policy was not framed so that students can chill and enjoy during classes, it was done so that students can pursue something that they think is more productive and adds more value to their life. The 0% attendance policy is mostly a bane for students just for this point. Most students take classes off for pleasure time.Those students who join BITS Pilani because the entrance exam for this University seems easier than JEE, beware. The first year in BITS Pilani is just a follow-up the subjects in JEE. So even if you are studying only for BITSAT, there is no harm in studying for the harder exam, its only going to help you later.Though a lot of students bitch about the first year, saying that it is useless and would not be related to their career, etc. The fact still remains that it contributes heavily to the CGPA at the time of graduation (almost 20–25% of your CGPA).Be ready to have a lower CGPA than your friends at other Institutes (be it a local one, or a better one- IITs or NITs). The average (and the median) grades given to students are 6 for most courses, meaning that the student with the average or median score at the end of a course will mostly get a 6 on 10. I have seen some of my friends at local colleges who have CGPA’s in 9.5+ region where the average grade in a course might be an 8. Though it is very hard to do it here, it is not impossible. A handful of students at the end of their first year achieve that, but its mostly impossible to continue that streak till graduation. The Valedictorians and the medalists at our college have that score, that’s all.With all these things being said, do not get scared. Yes, it is a challenge, but a very enjoyable and doable one at that, you will have loads of help in your journey as well. Of course this list is not exhaustive as well, so be ready to face new surprises as well. I will add to it when I think of new ones.

Not sure about the Pilani campus.Ample amount of freedom - this can lead to misuse if you’re not ready as a student. You must practice self discipline, else you’ll face a lot of hardship in resisting freedom that comes with no-attendance policy, like I did.Mix of all kinds of people - Apart from the usual North-South broad categories, there are all kinds of people with all kinds of beliefs and traditions coming in, and it takes time to adjust or mingle with each other. Some students from the South aren’t able to converse with North students and vice versa, and some feel a bit distant in other ways. It takes time to come together, but it happens gradually.Enough distractions if you’re not focused - There are all kinds of useful activities going on that can put you a bit off track from your academic work, if you’re not balancing them quite well. Although, this provides a stage for you to learn to develop a habit of handling everything.Strict guidelines against cheating in exams - Try your best never to indulge in such practices of copying during exams, or trying to carry slips / chits or whatever you call them. There have been cases where a whole semester of coursework of a student got canceled when they tried to cheat. As a result, one whole semester had to repeated later, in a disturbed way, which can increase your stay at college.Strict fines against alcoholics, smokers - Although this is quite easy to learn to indulge in such activities in secret, once caught you can be fined quite a lot, or even get your semester canceled. Though such cases are very rare, watch out.Loneliness - If you don’t have a strong friend circle, it’s quite easy to find yourself alone and lost. Although this can be true for every college, in Hyderabad campus, you have one room for each person and that can lock you down if you’re in the mood. This can lead to a bit of mental distress if you aren’t careful. You must constantly engage in some kind of activity which can keep you out of the rooms and interact with people.I have not added any technical / placement-oriented / education-related points because I believe there are no issues in that regard.

It's weird but matters to me.Reason for not choosing IIIT Banglore- I like Banglore as a city due to it’s awesome climate and IT culture.IIIT Banglore is located in Electronic City(Lot of opportunities outside campus).But it only offers 5 year iMtech courses, have a small 12 acres campus.Like IIIT D, schedule here is hectic too.Small peer group with students only for CS and ECEReasons for choosing BITS Hyderabad- I love Hyderabad’s rapidly growing IT industry which can offer internships outside campus while studying.0% attendance - Favourite point. I have some other plans alongside college and I need time for them. Nowhere else such a relieving option is available.They have a variety of clubs and all of them are functioning well.It has a better startup environment from IITs and they have their own startup incubator.Pearl, Atmos, Ignite, ArenaBITS Hyderabad's campus is beautiful with state of art infrastructure and amenities.Seniors are like friends and peer group is cool.All in all, now I feel that BITS Hyderabad is the best I could have had according to my interests and it feels like I was destined to be here.

You will find some pros and cons of joining BITS Pilani ENI, here; Pros: ENI as a branch offers much more future opportunities, prospects and scope than Mechanical. You have a choice to go for core or you can also sit for IT placements.BITS has an excellent start-up and entrepreneurship culture. Many top companies have developed from start-ups. It is comparable to an old IIT like Bombay or Kanpur. You can check on Google. Thus it's a more business oriented University.BITS Alumni (BITSAA) are one of the most successful and powerful, of colleges in India. You can connect and receive support from them in the future. This just tells about the college culture.BITS is ranked on an international scale on major rankings like QS World and QS subject, whereas IITBHU hasn't completed 10 years to feature yet. There is no guarantee that it will feature later though. IIT Hyderabad still isn't ranked on QS despite it being much older and being established in 2008. BHU, however, fares better than BITS on NIRF because of it's research.You will have much better Placements in BITS ENI than BHU Mech.Infrastructure of BITS is definitely better than IITBHU since BITS is a private college. The hostels, academics buildings, labs are pretty decent. Hostel food is very decent (unlike other government engineering colleges). Also, IIT-BHU shares it's campus with BHU. It might tend to get congested because of this.Cons: BITS has high fees. IIT-BHU has much lower fees.IITBHU is an IIT. Maybe that brand is useful for you. (That's what people say. I don't agree much with that. BITS also has a very good brand value in the industry. General public, however, will undoubtedly give lots of importance to IIT)It's growing fast. You can see from the NIRF rankings that IITBHU has made huge progress right from being established from ITBHU in 2012.Research is much better in IITBHU.You can connect with IIT Alumni and BHU Alumni easily. IIT alumni is probably easy to connect (than BITS alumni) because there are 23 IITs in India. Both IIT and BHU are also very successful.Other factors: Peer group is more or less the same. It is easy to believe that Peer group in BHU is more, because top rankers go there. That's just half the truth. BHU has around 60% reservation whereas BITS has negligible reservation. Plus, the number of seats in Pilani is easily more. That's because BITS has fewer engineering branches. Also, the seats in more demanded branches like CS are more than ones like Manufacturing. Hence, the best students in BHU are better than best in Pilani and worst in Pilani are better than the worst in BHU.College life is similar as well. BITS College life is easily comparable to top IITs. I will say, College life in BITS is slightly better because of better infrastructure and the fact that BHU shares it's campus (That's my personal opinion.)So, that was a comprehensive comparison. I feel you should go for BITS Pilani ENI, in case of no specific interest/interest in Electronics. However, if (after seeing the 4–5 year course circullum, doing some research about future prospects and talking with pass-outs) you are strongly interested in Mechanical, you should go for IITBHU Mechanical. It's a very decent college and one of the choices for toppers. ",0.28634680851063826,Positive,3.5726936170212764,0.023391812865497075,1,4.572693617021276

Also if you want to settle abroad with a job in a software company then go for BITS ENI. If you want to go for research, take up any of the two. It would hardly matter. But, if you have an inclination towards PSU( Public Sector Units) then prefer Mechanical over ENI as the competition in ENI is immense in India. ENI is in demand abroad. Also, I would like to add that branch change in BHU is not very difficult if you are sincere from Day 1 as some seniors told me when I enquired about BHU. You get a branch change depending upon your first semesters result where the load is less. Finally, take BHU if you want that IIT Tag. The state of BHU has change a lot from what is used to be say 8 years back. This is what I have learnt from some seniors. It has better facilities, faculty, LAN speed, etc. NOTE- I personally would have chosen IIT BHU Mechanical over BITS Pilani ENI if I were in your place.

Waste of time in my view, unless you have a very specific reason. Writing for BITSAT is even more shameful. Suppose you got only 1L in JEE mains and you are writing for BITS CSE in Pilani, you are obviously over stretching yourself. In summary, unless you have a clear reason for the failure this year, say due to illness or you were into sports fully and planning to leave it and concentrate only on studies or some other difficulties or situations, it makes absolutely no sense to repeat, especially if you have a decent option even if it is not one of the best. Banging against the wall will not make it move, worse still by changing your preparation style your rank wont move up from 1L to 100 and if you want it to move from 3K to 300, it does not really benefit so much in the long run of what is called as LIFE.

A new phase of life requires a new you.Develop social skills: You've never before stepped into a world where everyone is smart and driven. Every person you meet will be doing well in life after 10 years. Connecting with such people is only going to expand your mind. There's no reason to hesitate before talking to anyone because most of the people will be as hesitant as you. As the saying goes “Your network is your networth.” The seeds are planted from this moment onwards.Explore your interests: Do you really want to become a machine learning engineer or a data analyst? If you end up in a career that you hate even after so many opportunities to explore a wide range of careers, you'll be responsible for the misery it brings to you. Try to get into all the departments and clubs that interest you, then leave them as soon as you realise you don't like them.Talk to a lot of seniors: There’s no such thing as ragging in the Goa campus, seniors are the most helpful people you'll ever find. Initially, it's going to be hard to find seniors who are actually more matured than you. However, it won't take you a few conversations to realise whom you shall approach if you have a particular type of problem. I've been super lucky to get to stay in a fourthie hostel, they were always available for any sort of help just like real elder brothers! So I'd say talk to the ones who are in the third or the fourth year if you want some solid advises.Learn how to handle stress: Find your ways of handling stress because you'll mostly have lots of it. People have different ways of doing the same, you have to find yours. PS- It's not crying and posting sad memes.Read lots of books: No, I'm not talking about math, thermodynamics or mechanics books. I'm talking about the ones that have created great men throughout the advent of modern civilization. The books that teach you how to mould yourself into someone that is more likely to succeed. Self-development is as important as technical knowledge in the long run.Life is not fair, get used to it: (often attributed to Bill Gates) If you have this fixed in your mind from the beginning of your true career building years, you'll face the moments of despair with much more optimism.",0.111,Positive,3.222,0.07602339181286549,1,4.2219999999999995

Last minute studying is only good if you are okay on getting average marks in the course. If you cgpa is imp to you, then you will have to attend a fair amount of classes, both lectures and tutorials!Freedom in making timetables: This is actually a good thing in my opinion, as you can choose the teachers from which you want to study. You can even set one day as really hectic( full of classes and labs) and Friday and Saturday light, so that you can have a 3-day weekend! Although, do leave out a couple of hours around 12–2 pm for lunch. Some people even have classes during lunch hours, and that’s simply due to mismanagement. If you generally wake up at 10 am, you can keep most of your classes after 10, so that your body clock doesnt get disturbed.Seniors: Idk about other colleges, but in BITS, the seniors are kind of our on-campus-parents. They may seem a little scary and intense at first, but once you get to know them (and they, you) you’ll realise that each one of them has a treasure trove of knowledge and experience for you to learn. Everything that you are about to experience, most of them have already done it. So dont be afraid to reach out to any of them. They also help us have a fun time. So, even if you are an introvert, make efforts to get to know, not only your batchmates, but also your seniors. Even if you get on someone’s wrong side, PLEASE, don’t let your ego get in the way and simply apologise! it can go a long way.Batchmates: During your first few weeks, you may not want to get out of your room (homesickness or whatever). DONT DO THIS. GO out, meet people, find people with similar interests, stalk seniors xD, find out about clubs and departments which you find interesting. Just don’t sit in a corner and expect anyone to hold your hand thru college. You’ll have to be independent now.In conclusion, BITS is unlike any other college. WHile other colleges make you follow a strict routine, BITS give you the freedom and responsibility to literally do what you want. After these 4/5 years here, you can come out as a 9-pointer with awesome placements, a low-pointer with awesome placements, a UI-UX designer, an MBA aspirant, UPSC, etc. It is all upto you.

The formal one also comes along with a stipend of Rs. 5000 which might not be a lot, but still a token of appreciation from the institute's side. The informal one does not have a stipend. The formal one is based on the interests and the form filled out by the student which is in turn alloted based on the CGPA and the grade in that course of the student (similar to the PS allotment or BITSAT allotment). There is also a minimum cut-off of 7 CGPA to be eligible to become a TA. So it's usually the ones with 8.3ish+ CGPA and an A grade in that course which will get someone a TAship for the mass courses like OOP or CP. For courses which do not require that many TAs, they take students with 9+ CGPA and an A grade. Every semester, one student can be alloted only one formal TAship, hence you find a lot of brilliant students taking one or more informal TAships before the start of the semester. Also, for an informal TAship, you could approach the IC. For informal TAship, they look for an A grade in the course (maybe even an A- if it's a mass course). The work given to TAs depends on the course itself as it's structure is the one that matters. Lab courses will require TAs to set the question(s) for the lab and to also help the students taking the course to solve the lab problem(s) (ex: OOP). Some courses also need TAs to teach as well (ex: DISCO and DSA). Some courses just need the TAs to be an attendance-boy who floats around the attendance sheet and makes sure nobody does a proxy (ex: M1 and ES). Some courses will require the TAs to correct the answer scripts of students as well (first round and recheck also maybe) So it's completely dependent on the course, it's structure and the IC of the course.

You might get exam invigilation duty and even paper correction. Life will be good if the subject assigned interests you or you are comfortable with it. Very less interaction with faculty and more with students.Assistant to a Prof: you will be asked to help the prof with his or her daily tasks. Mostly work related to research projects or some mundane day to day activities. Here the work/working hours mostly depends on faculty. Work could be anything from finding real life examples for some scientific theory to checking tutorials.WILP : Job role in WILP department is pretty much well defined. You will have to check answer sheets for a particular subject. The faculty who is taking that subject might be on campus or off campus. Generally WILP will have semester and mid semester exams 2 weeks ahead of on campus schedule. You will be asked to check the answer sheets in the application (custom software designed wherein each answer sheet is scanned and provided to you. You just have to tick mark with mouse and put score for each answer). During my time for about 150 answer sheets there used to be one TA. Work is assigned only during the paper evaluation time. So you can chill all sem but during the exam time you will have to spare some midnight oil. If the faculty is off campus you would just interact in few mails or telephone calls.In summary I would say that work is not that hectic and one can easily manage academics with TA. Just don't be greedy and take more than 2 TA in single semester - especially if you are the one who prepares for exam in the last minute. There will be an application process including profile / CGPA based short listing and interview. Generally if you have a good academic score and a good rapport you can easily get a TA. Choose the subjects wisely. PS: There are few subjects in WILP with very few answer sheets to correct and off campus faculty. Choose those if you are a lit person.

Be careful, your M.Sc. degree can easily make your academic life hell.Most (99%) students opt with the hopes of getting a CSE B.E. unfortunately, most of these students will not be able to and are not able to do so. That's just the way BITS Pilani has designed it's courses. There are only so many seats in CS dual batch. (If you're wondering why I'm only using CS as the example, it's because most of the students, 99% of them have opted for M.Sc. dual degree just so as to take CS as their dual.)Circuit branches, alone as a single degree are hard. M.Sc. Physics and Maths are hard by themselves. Now a combination of these two is a very high percentage, and will make your life significantly harder, even more so if you don't like either one or both.Most M.Sc. degrees will not give you your job, it'll mostly be your B.E. degree doing that. (M.Sc. Economics might be an exception to this, because of the finance jobs. Even then, there are not that many jobs as well).But if you're interested in pursuing an M.S after graduating, a dual degree will surely help. A Physics/Maths + Circuit branch or Bio + CS is just too good if you've done both of them in such a way you understand the intricacies. Any too university would love to have you.Dualites, especially Bio and Chemistry students are looked down on. Not just by other students, but also by a lot of the faculty. There have multiple incidents where this has happened, whether the faculty meant it as a joke or not is a different thing. For example, some teachers jokingly said that their section didn't score well in a test or exam because their section is mostly filled with dualites.Now, coming to the suggestions since you know the reality of dualites in BITS Pilani: You will see a lot of your single degree friends slacking off in the first year, let them, but make sure you don't slack off. Try to explore all the B.E branches, talk to professors, interact with seniors about the opportunities one has after taking that B.E dual, and then make your decision. Make sure your CGPA at the end of first year is enough to get you any dual, even CS, but choose a dual degree of your liking. Again, as I said, it's mathematically not possible for everyone to be able to get CS as a dual, but nothing is stopping you from trying. If you want it, go get it.I would like to say don't choose CS just because most of the others are, but I know that most students won't listen to this.There is a very good chance that you might not get a B.E. degree of your choice, be ready to live with that.Continue to work harder than your peers after first year as well, it will surely take you places.Now, my point was not to discourage you, it was to give you a hint of what is to come in the next 5 years.Do not get discouraged when people joke or put dualites in bad light. You know what you're in BITS Pilani for, so don't let anyone to stray you from your goal. This will not just be the case of dualites, people will talk for anything and everything, and will continue for the rest of your life. Learn to live with it as you can't educate all the fools on the planet.The dual degree program is an amazing program, I would urge students who have scored much more than the MSC and BE cut offs to also opt for a dual degree if they're interested in any of the M.Sc courses.If you're someone who is weighing a B.E degree in a good local college Vs a dual at BITS Pilani. Though I would suggest BITS (even if you're interested in a specific branch, you can easily get the same in BITS after a year), please do give it a careful thought, and choose wisely. Please do refer to a lot of opinions and views, before making your decision. You can view my answers on these topics to help yourself.I know that all these suggestions are a lot easier said than done. But they're still very doable. All the best!

If I were in your shoes, I would not think twice and directly go for IIT Delhi (I am not desperate for CS, that's why). EDIT - Some addition info: IMO if the aspirant is serious to go into IT sector, a CSE undergraduation is a better option. Of course, coding should be learnt for any branch, since it is required everywhere. Consider coding as a sport. People can take it up as a hobby, to improve their skills, etc. But if someone is genually interested in making a career out of it, then it's better to get into a sports institute, right? Now, many sportsmen have come up from undergrad in some other field (akin to non-core), but someone coming up from a sports insti obviously will have the upper hand. Although IIT D is better than BITS P, but in terms of CS, BITS P is still a top-tier college, and the aspirant won't miss out (especially if he has genuine interest). I have many friends who take BITS P CS with ranks under 1000 (they didn't get top 5 IIT CS). So, in short, interest should be of primary concern to choose between these two.

All these things are non existent in IIT BHU. Now coming to my biased opinion about branch, even though I believe, no branch is bad and no branch lacks scope, the general public believes in Mechanical Engineering being an evergreen branch and I prefer that branch because I was always more interested in it than any other branch (ceramics), but your interest matters more than general audience. As far as MBA is concerned, you can always go to ceramics from Mechanical but you can't go the other way round. But then many people in their first year go to the college with the aim of doing an MS after it but most turn to MBA or leave MS aside because of lack of interest, so even though your motivation is good, but it may be short lived. So my final opinion is going to BITS Pilani (only Pilani campus) Mechanical Engineering. But be free to choose the other option as it will not lead to a bad future or something (the future in both the scenerios be as good as you want and directly proportional to your hardwork).

I’ll list out a few pointers that can help you get started (though some may seem a little obvious): If you have no idea about your interests, I’d suggest trying out a few different areas which involve programming. Personally, I started with backend web-development in django (a python framework). You could try front end web development, building apps and games or even get into machine learning. Of course, there is probably no end to this but follow your best judgement.The first point will be easier if you join a few technical clubs at BITS. I joined the Coding Club and ACM in my first year. DVM is another technologically inclined department. You will be around other first years who are discovering their own interests. Also, the seniors at your club have already worked this out (most of them, at least) and will guide you better.Coming back to the first point, in any field you work on, please do not keep watching tutorials. In the same way as busy is different from productive, you will just waste your time after a certain point. Programming is a practical, hands-on task and in my opinion, should be learned that way.Following the above point, work on personal projects, however small. Later on, you can combine different elements of your smaller projects to make something more complete. Make an account on GitHub or GitLab or some other code sharing/development site and put your projects there. You will have something to show as proof of your skills.Learn to use GitHub and git. These are really important, especially from a software engineering perspective. Though they are in no way difficult, it will take time for you to get comfortable with them.The first points I have written are based on the assumption that you have no inclination to a particular language. The fields I mentioned above use several different technologies and frameworks. Apart from those, I recommend learning C or C++. Unlike newer and more high-level languages like Python, they give you a better idea of what goes on when you run a program. Of course, you will have a C-based programming course in your first year.Though this is in no way a necessity, I would recommend dual booting a Unix based operating system or atleast using a Virtual Machine. If you are using a Macbook, that’s great. But if you are using Windows, have a go at using Ubuntu (a Linux based operation system) or something else if you want. You will be learning Unix as part of your programming course in the first year. I use Ubuntu and it has definitely given me a better idea about programming in general. You will also get comfortable with using the terminal (command line) rather than just the GUI.If you discover that you like a particular field (after trying a few others out), go deeper into it. For example, if you like machine learning and choose the Python programming language as your tool, try out some MOOCs, setup a Kaggle account and follow machine learning blogs. Kaggle allows you to compete in machine learning competitions.If you want to know specifically about your branch, I think you will have a lot of Verilog (an HDL) and assembly programming in your courses. You can follow most of the above points for these.Try out competitive programming. It will make your programming fundamentals stronger and improve your problem solving skills. You can take a Data Structures and Algorithms elective later on in your degree. HackerRank, CodeChef and Codeforces are a few good sites to try out.Try getting internships, even after your first year. They are really important in gaining experience and soft skills alongside programming skills. If you want to get really into software development you can also have a look at the Summer of Code program by Google, held during the summer.Lastly, don’t compare yourself with others. There are bound to be people who started programming much earlier than you and would be naturally better than you. Very few things are substitutes for hard work and passion, so focus on what matters.I think I have touched on most points, if not all. Please let me know in the comments and I’ll edit my answer to include them. ",0.256345,Positive,3.51269,0.06432748538011696,1,4.51269

The cutoff for any branch depends on many factors like fees,other college options,number of seats,difficulty level of paper etc.Considering all these factors,cutoffs vary each year. However,a general trend has been observed regarding fall in cutoffs. For 2nd iteration-generally,the cutoffs reduce by more than 15 marks as compared to the 1st iteration.This is mainly due to the fact that the students offered admissions have to pay Rs.2.17L to continue in the further rounds.Also,JEE(A) results are already out by this time,so students may look for options in IITs and NITs. For 3rd,4th and 5th iteration-the cutoffs reduce around 2–3 marks in each round.However in 2017,an enormous fall was observed in 5th iteration.So,it is kind of fluctuating for these rounds but in general,you won’t observe a fall of more than 5 marks. So,even if you are some 20–22 marks behind the cutoff after the 1st iteration,you’re in with a really good chance.And if you’re some 15 marks behind the cutoff in your desired branch,in all probability,you’ll get your desired seat.

Over time, the villagers discovered a cash crop; they started making good money. They invited all kinds of retailers of semi-luxury goods to set up shop in their premises; the potter, a poor man, was asked to leave. All went well until a mild earthquake shook the locality. All their earthenware was broken. Frantically, they looked for a seller; however, the goldsmiths and the soap-and-shampoo guys could not help them. That night they starved. The next day, a group set out to locate the potter, who, never a man to nurse a grudge, not only agreed to make pots for them but also to set up his wheel in their premises once again. The villagers were so pleased, they not only gave him rent-free space; they arranged a monthly retainer for him to keep him incentivized. Chemical engineering as an academic discipline has always suffered from the fact that the things that chemical engineers do as professionals are not easily demonstrated in a way that conveys understanding to the general public, or even to engineering students who are just starting to pursue their technical courses. (Every secondary school student can relate to robots, bridges, computers, or heart-lung machines, but how do you easily convey the beauty and societal importance of an optimally designed pharmaceutical process or the exponential cost of improved separation?) The traditional introductory course in chemical engineering has usually been called something like “Material and Energy Balances,” and the course has typically focused on flowsheet analysis, overall mass balance and equilibrium calculations, and process applications of thermochemistry. Such courses rarely explore the scope of the truly challenging and interesting problems that occupy today’s chemical engineers. Chemical Engineering: An Introduction, Morton M. Denn. Likewise, “functions of buildings and structure in general. Loads on buildings as per IS 875, IS 1893 and NBC”; “functional requirements of buildings and necessity of byelaws”; “Concrete as a material, its ingredients and Concrete Production Process including prefabrication, modular coordination” do not sound sexy. And “Analysis of stresses, Analysis of Strain, Geometry of deformation of a twisted circular shaft, Stress and deformation in twisted circular solid and hollow shafts, Strain energy due to torsion , Power transmitted by circular shafts” could be mistaken by an IAS guy as confessions made to a doctor, but where would you be without safe structures? Again, coming to Odisha, do you know what saved lakhs of lives during Cyclone Fani? Many factors, but an important one was the Civil Engineering professors of IIT Kharagpur: One of the first steps taken after the 1999 disaster was the construction of hundreds of cyclone shelters up and down the coast. The shelters are built up to a few miles from the seashore. They aren’t picturesque — picture a bare two-story, peeling-paint, cement-block rectangular building on stilts, almost resembling a crab. But the structures, designed by the faculty at one of India’s elite universities, I.I.T. Kharagpur, have proved storm-worthy. How Do You Save a Million People From a Cyclone? Ask a Poor State in India The New York Times, May 3, 2019 Do not attempt to discourage or denigrate ANY branch of engineering. We are barely reaching universal literacy after hundreds of years of ignorance.  We are IN NO POSITION to make fun of our future nation-builders. If these boys and girls are discouraged, it is not their fault; it is the nation’s fault. How do you ask a man to climb a tree when there is no tree to start with? Years of pandering to fake Nehruvian socialism have discouraged the private sector from developing, nay, nipped in the bud. Nehru, Morarji Desai, Indira Gandhi, Rajiv Gandhi…. what a bunch of jerks. I accept my share of the blame for this situation. But India is changing. All these skills are going to be needed. And, like in that village in Odisha, without the potter, there is no society! (And, incidentally, that “potter” today uses Matlab and Mathematica and CATIA CAD/CAM and ANSYS and FLUENT and NASTRAN and R and FEATool Multiphysics FreeFEM++ Elmer and OpenSees and Deal II and …) What is the best open source finite element software for mechanical problems?

Most of the other times people usually wear shorts or track pants (yes, even in classes).Get your laboratory coat (white) if you have one, as you'll have to spend on a new one otherwise (and the tailor rips you off here).Get as many snacks as possible from home, you'll end up missing home food soon enough (you'll also get bored of the food at the on-campus eateries).Get some basic sports equipment if possible, so you can play in the small areas in your hostel (or if you're serious about your sport, you can play in the student activity center).Get a few water bottles if possible. I like to stack up my water for the day with 4 one litre bottles (but this is an extreme case). There are people at the other end of the spectrum as well who just own a tumbler and keep going to the water dispenser whenever they require water. Having 2 bottles should be manageable.You don't really need any reference books from home as you'll more than easily find yourself a book-set for your first year. But you can still get your favourite books in any of PCMB subjects if you're really attached to them.Don't get any utensils like buckets, you get them all here.You don't really need things like your brush, soap, etc as you will then here as well, but it's better to carry these essentials as you might need it for the first few days when you haven't visited the stores yet.Get a portable speaker if possible, or if you want a bigger and better 2.1 surround system, you can always come to campus and order it online or get a hand-me-down from seniors. This is a very useful item, trust me.Get a study lamp if possible, though you can order it online once you get here as well.Get a USB flash drive and/or a hard disk drive depending on if you're carrying your laptop or not.Coming to laptop, it's your wish, but hear me out before you make your decision.It is possible to make-do without a laptop.You can always use the computers in the computer lab or the ones in the digital section of the library. These have some timings in between which you can use them thoughYou will need the use of a computer to practice for - engineering graphics lab (you might spend a lot of time on this), computer programming lab and physics lab as well. Most of the times you will be needing the use of a computer after the timings of the computer center.Some hostels are pretty far away from the computer center, so having a laptop with you will ease your life.A lot of club and department work will require the use of a computer, again you use the ones at the computer center or the digital library, and I said told you before the only problems are distance and timings.A lot of students join CTEs (extra courses taken by seniors) or TIPs (projects mentored by seniors) for which you'll need your laptop.99% of the slides and study materials are uploaded onto Moodle which you can access from your phone as well, but it's always better on a laptop/desktop computer.A lot of people including my own seniors suggested not getting a laptop in the first year if you want to focus on academics as DC++ is present. But I think “no play and all work makes Jack a dull boy”.As I earlier said, it's your decision, but whatever decision you make, choose wisely depending on your situation.It is completely possible to live without a laptop, but it involves a lot of pestering your neighbors for their laptop whenever you need it. I would personally suggest getting one. But as I said, it's your choice.Whatever you miss from getting home can always be couriered to you if it's very important, you can also get it ordered online to campus. And if you can wait, you can always get it the next time you go home during long weekends or festivals.I may have missed a lot of essential items, so please do refer to other lists of the same sort and finally making a list of your own based on your needs and necessities.All the best!

It can give you the overall development that you seek in a college, it's just that you need to be willing to take that from it. It's course curriculum is fantastic and up to date, and in this it beats IITs by a huge margin because IITs are still following the old curriculum. BITs makes you skilled in the things which are required according to current job trends. It's sports facilities are good (not excellent, because sometimes you have to wait a lot to play and the timings are quite restricting). It's extracurricular activities are amazing. But the only problem is that if you want to join a club, you have to be really skilled in the work the club does. For example, if you are interested in dramatics you need to act well. Its not like you can learn from them by actually doing it. Joining departments is a headache. Most people don't even know how to join departments. You have to be in touch with right seniors at the right time (no these seniors won't tell you the departments they are in, due to some logic which is still out of my reach). And most of the departments don't even do the work you would assume they do by their names. For example, Department of Theatre doesn't perform in the dramatics events, they help in stage decoration and all (similar work, I don't know the exact thing). Library and all is amazing. The air quality is amazing and the air is very fresh with neem trees located throughout the campus. The campus is beautiful and the hostels are the best you can get. Well maintained and hygienic. In this BITS beats all it's direct competitors. Mess food is the best you can have in a college (even though eventually it will become boring and tasteless ;)). Peer group is amazing with all general category guys (yeah you read it right, guys because girls are joining IITs due to girls reservation). Teachers are pathetic (except for some), But this is no different than other colleges, top IITs for that matter. All these colleges have teachers who have vast experience and knowledge of their fields but are not good teachers. It's tag and placements are good, exactly what you might have heard. You will find people from almost all states in BITS, this helps in getting to know about them and being able to talk with people from all parts of the country. In IITs the people coming are limited to some states, for example a Chennai student may prefer IIT Chennai over Delhi while it may be other way round for a Delhi guy. This makes the diversity in IIT lesser than in BITS. In terms of all these things combined, I think BITS comes after the top 5 IITs in my opinion. In terms of overall development, BITS comes directly below IIT Bombay and Delhi, maybe even above Delhi. So finally, If you take my opinion, you should join BITS if you are not getting the stream of your choice, while if your aim is to go for overall development you should consider BITS after IIT Bombay and Delhi. PS: Not related to your question but important for engineering aspirants - Stream of your choice means the one you like or the one you can carry out your 4 years in. For example, if you take my example, I m pathetic in coding, hence for me CS is not at all a branch to take even though it's considered the best branch(in terms of placements). Plus don't ever judge a branch by it's placements, most engineering degrees require experience and hence once you get good experience, your pay scale increases exponentially. While CS is not even an engineering degree (sorry CS guys, but you know that's the truth) and hence doesn't require much experience and coding and all can be done by even the non CS guys with minimal effort (again depends on the persons callibre as well, like for me, this statement is invalid as I m pretty bad in coding).

He has had constant support from the government, since the very announcement of Jio Institute. Inclusion of Jio institute in the Institutes of Eminence by the Government of India, even before its establishment, supports my statement.Jio has a reputed stature to take care of. Unlike other private institutes, Jio will not be doing malpractices just for the sake of some profit. Also, It, being made an Institute of Eminence, will be taking care to keep the tag.Institutes need time to grow, to build a reputation, to grow a good alumni-network, to avail different facilities. All of this won’t come in a snap of fingers. Institutions are like wine, the older they are, the better they will be.Considering these factors, I personally think that Jio is going to excel as an institute. I might have not covered all points, so feel free to put forward new arguments, it will just make my answer better. Cheers to Peace!

Start talking more to different people, ask about their life and their experiences. This will make you better at conversations. Do remember, clubs and departments mostly take up interesting people.In academics point of view, I would recommend you to learn C and learn all its basics first. The more advanced part will be taught in the first year. Start with the book, Let us C! by Yashawant Kanetkar. C will come handy both in academics and in competitive programming.That is all.

In reality your Priority Number decides your fate in this area. 4)Branch change is not an option at all. To change your branch you have to get CG which is equal to CG of 5 toppers of the branch. It indirectly means you need 10 CG to get a branch change. 5)A person who wants to change his branch to CS/EEE/ENI/Mech needs a CG of roughly 10/10/9.8/9.8. while a dual degree student may get these branches for CG approx equal to 8.3/7.5/7/6.5. This is pretty unfair to those who actually joined the institute with higher marks in BITSAT than their dual counterparts, but still lag behind them after first year due to this. 6)Not a dirty secret but as IITs have started girls reservation, no. of girls joining BITS has reduced drastically. 7) Joining this institute you will have no outside scampus life as Pilani is a small village. There is literally nothing outside the campus even though the institute is there since 60 yrs or so. 8)As there are no reservations, all students are quite good and hence getting a decent CG becomes even more difficult. 9)Average CG of BITS is less than 6.5 while the average CG of top IITs is roughly 7.3. This makes a BITSian score less than his counterpart in IIT. And the companies visiting in both the colleges have CG cutoff of roughly 7.5, thus roughly all general category guys clear placement CG Cutoff in IITs, in BITs more than half don’t. 10)Due to above 2 points and the fact that the IIT tag is greater than the BITs tag, BITSians lag behind IITians of top 5–7 IITs even though they might be equal or even better in their fields. 11)In BITS if your CG is less you may face depression because you might not be able to change your CG much. Personally, I haven't seen many people change their CG much. While in IITs you already have a decent CG if you are general category and you have confidence because many people you meet have CGs much lesser being reserved category (a generalisation and I know many people don't follow this trend) 12)A BITsian almost always sees himself/herself as inferior to their IITian counterparts due to above points plus the fact that almost every BITSian wanted to go to the top 5 IITs. Even though I can assure you that almost half of the BITsians have qualified the JEE with the best rankers having ranks as low as 1000. And the other half who haven't are way better than the reserved category students in IITs (exceptions may be there). 13)Even though many people don't like it (some do too), BITS Goa/Hyderabad are referred to as BITS Pilani… Goa/Hyderabad campus. It actually doesn't matter from where you get your degree. All these points are based on my experience in both colleges(BITS and top 5 IITs) and talking to people in both colleges. PS: On finding out more I got to know that one of my previous points was wrong, I have rectified it, But I have heard different things related to that point from different people (see comments section as a proof :) ).

You would also get a great campus life and be happy with coding. It also enjoys years of alumni outreach. However, it's definitely hot in Pilani and has a huge fees. Moreover, 0% attendance can sometimes make you very lenient and may affect your later phase of life. Now comes to IITG MnC. Inducted around 2011, this branch offers BTech degree and has course with 45–50% maths,45% CS and some finance courses. It is completely concerned with software orientation and unlike CS doesn't care of hardware limitations. The maths courses are definitely tough but important for neural networks and AI. You can google for Neural Networks system. The finance courses help in investment banks and also give them edge for MBA. The campus life in IITG is definitely good and the weather is pleasent. However, the coding culture is lacking compared to the other two. The location and young alumni network is also a factor. And the profs are gods out here unlike in BITS.

In return, BITS offers a quality 2/4/5 years of education. There are highly qualified teachers whose credentials are available for the students to examine. I believe the system here was modelled after MITs system. This education may provide excellent base for the future career of the student. There are many internship opportunities, workshops, seminars etc here. A job. Literally every other engineers dream. The average ctc this year was 12.8 lakhs afaik, and median was 11. something. This is only expected to increase. Highest packages were in a league by themselves, even the domestic ones. I don't remember the exact figures (I was a fresher when I read that, gimme a break), but they were more or less the twice of average ctcs in that particular field. The library is good too. You can get knowledge in the fields of your interest, particularly finance, management, or specialised engineering disciplines, if you are so inclined. There are shelves of books, reading halls, ac reading rooms, even quaint historical books. The library itself is built in a palatial and airy way, which makes it a very relaxing environment, especially in evening and night. The hostels are fairly good. A bed, shelf, table, almirah, a fan, a tube light, and if you are a girl or in the ancient hostels, a balcony. No AC, unfortunately. Although a hostel has cooling ducts installed. Two common rooms, with a TV, cooler, and huge seating area in one, and tt table, and vending machines, and the promised stuff (foosball table, and pull up, push up bars, dumbells, etc).Just a note, I haven't the faintest idea about how the blocks in Meera Bhawan (Girl's hostel) are arranged. In addition, there are representatives who will arrange for newspapers, and such bonuses, and a sports dude who gives shuttles, balls, and carrom or chess boards. I usually hate comparisons, but it is said by some here that education at any of the IITs cost 6 lakhs (not sure about this), and about 60-70% is subsidised by the govt. BITS education costs 4 lakhs, which you have to pay as this is a private institute. Also there are education loans, which offer somewhat relaxed terms compared to outside environment, and scholarships for the meritorious but financially weak students. Ultimately, the decision rests with the aspirants and his parents, but I feel that I have exhaustively justified most of the fee structure. Edit: The average ctc was greater than 12.8. My mistake. Thank you Aditya for pointing that out. For the 1st sem, average ctc was 15.5, and for the second sem, average ctc was 12.8 lpa. ",0.15070000000000006,Positive,3.3014,0.08771929824561403,1,4.3014

Worst part is the whole internship was online, they were expecting to students to pay more for something totally worthless and that too online.Recently it was declared that the coming semester will be online but they again didn’t forget to increase the semester tuition fee. It’s ridiculous how they are demanding such high fee for a semester where there won’t be any lab or study environment. Even someone with half a brain cell could tell the difference between online and offline education. Earlier I used to be the one believing BITS is underrated and fee is justified but not anymore. Questioning the administration is also like just pushing a wall nothing comes out from it.Now I would not recommend any future aspirant to join BITS if they value their money other institutions might not provide everything but at least don’t empty your pockets. Earlier BITS might be worth but now studying in a good NIT is much better option to spend your money than being fooled by all the overall development hype.BITS has given me nothing but pain and stress. They have a strict discipline and harsh grading system, other places are better if you wanna have a fun and stress free college life, the education does not matter at the end everyone gets placed based on their coding skills. For anyone wanna join BITS remember mental health more important than placement, here only 2 things are constant falling cg and rising fee.

Dual degree implies a degree in sciences and another in engineering. The MSc. Courses offered are Biology, Chemistry, Economics, Maths and Physics. Once you're registered in above courses, you will study the common subjects for the first year. Then on the basis of your CGPA at the end of first year, you will awarded an Engineering Branch. The twist starts from second year. You'll study courses of your Science degree. No courses of your engineering degree will be taught to you while single degree will start having their engineering courses started. On reaching third year, dual degree student will study courses of MSc third year and his engineering second year courses. Yeah , You'll need to study both degree courses simultaneously. Now, in the fourth year , a dual degree student will study 3rd year courses of engineering degree whereas a single degree student would go for the industrial training for 6 months and complete the remaining few courses in the another 6 months. This will also be time when the single degree students would sit for placements. Apart from core courses, you'll need to study humanities(HuEL's) as well as disciplinary (DEL's) electives which depends on a student how one plans.

I'll try my best not to be biased to my college even though I chose NITK surathkal over bits pilani last year. Comparison is made with respect to btech cse( not other branches). 1.Brand : Both the institutions do not have brand value equivalent to an IIT.

I will try comparing nit ( warangal, trichy) and BITS pilani(pilani campus) for cse based on the following factors. I'll try my best not to be biased to my college even though I chose NITK surathkal over bits pilani last year. Comparison is made with respect to btech cse( not other branches). 1.Brand : Both the institutions do not have brand value equivalent to an IIT. Since RECs were made NIT in 2002, NIT brand is a bit newer compared to bits pilani, which as a brand is much older. Another problem with NITs is that there are 31 of them and only 3–4 of the NITs (Trichy , warangal, Surathkal) come close in comparison to middle IITs and bits pilani. There is a huge difference between top 3–4 NITs and the bottom 10 ( especially North East NITs) , which creates a big difference in perception. But still both the institutions have good brand value among recruiters and other people in engineering field and hence there isn't a big difference between brand values of top nits and bits pilani, though bits pilani had an extra edge over NIT brand. Therefore result according to brand value : IIT >>> BITS Pilani ~>NIT. 2. Placements : Both the institutions have excellent placements for cse branch, average placements for top nits ( trichy, warangal) for cse / IT is around 19 lpa, while even bits pilani will have average around 23 lpa according to some bitsians . The reason for average packages to be higher at bits pilani is because bits pilani doesn't have reservation, but sadly top nits do have reservation like iits, hence the difference. But average packages for general category students ( or those who do good) at top nits from cse is excellent and is comparable to iits and bits Pilani. So placements wise Bits pilani ~ Nits, provided you are general category ( no offence intended) . You can refer the college websites or ask 3rd or final year students ( not freshers) for accurate information since most of the answers in quora are biased. 3. Fee : Here comes the main difference, you will have to spend 3 times the amount you spend at nits, for the same degree at bits pilani. The recent fee hike at bits has reduced the cutoffs and increased the cutoffs at top nits ( this was true at 2018, and I myself secured seat at both bits pilani and NITK) . Spending 24+ lacs on btech isn't a joke and not everyone who cleared jee advanced , bitsat can afford it. Hence NIT >>>BITS pilani in terms of cost. 4. Curriculum : Since I am not from cse branch, you can download the syllabus bfrom the respective colleges and compare it with someone from software industry. 5. Crowd : No doubt bits pilani wins here since bits pilani has no reservation and admission is solely based on bitsat score. Top nits also have good crowd ( jee mains is thougher than bitsat), especially the general category crowd in top nits is excellent with most of them cleared jee advance, and is comparable to bits pilani. But sadly due to caste based reservation there are quite a few undeserving folks out here in nits and iits. The overall crowd at bits pilani is better, and I feel it is better than some iits also due to absence of caste based reservation. Hence BITS Pilani > >NIT(trichy, warangal), bits pilani easily wins here. 6. Hostel / Mess : Bits pilani being a private college will have slightly better messes and hostels, but again top nits also have good hostels. Not warangal has the best hostels among nits ( google for the pics) and at nitk surathkal hostels are decent and single room facility is available after first year. I feel hostels are worth for the price you pay at nits, and there isn't a big difference between hostels at both the colleges. Coming to mess, it is influenced by the location. South Indians are generally fine with mess food at top nits down South, but North India folks out there would find it difficult to get accustomed to the food habits at nit trichy, surathkal, warangal. Mess food generally tastes bad irrespective of college . Also remember you are paying much more at bits hostels/mess while nits are much cheaper and still manageable. 7. Faculty : I feel all colleges will have some good faculty, at the same time some bad faculty also. I suggest the reader to look into the faculty of bits, nits from their official website to look into profiles of all the professors for actual info rather than reading biased answers out here . I feel that it is the students who make these institutions grow, and hence an ambitious student can shine at both nits and bits pilani. I would suggest you not to just decide based on answers on quora. Better research on your own. ",0.2056857142857143,Positive,3.4113714285714285,0.011695906432748537,0,3.4113714285714285

Many students do it. BUT, it requires great amount of dedication and focus throughout your first-year. So be mentally prepared for it. Exams are not a cakewalk, and remember you will be living in a hostel - a completely different environment than your home; where you have to take care of everything along with your studies. Its very easy to get distracted by games/TV-shows etc. BUT REMEMBER, THAT ITS POSSIBLE AND PEOPLE HAVE DONE IT EVERY YEAR. But if you fail to do it, remember you are a B. Pharma student now. Sadly, the placement in core is not so good. So mostly people go for higher studies or opt for a non-core job. Second, much more safer option is that you don’t go for the brand name and opt for LMNIIT Jaipur (or Thapar if you want to). LMNIIT has a great coding culture and many people from there clear GSOC each year. There you get a good branch and a good college as well. Develop your coding skills and other skills as well. See, in the long run, skill is the only thing that matters (and not your college name). 10 years down the line it won’t even matter. If you want to go for future studies like MS or MBA then college matters and so does your CGPA. LORs from good Profs. carry a huge weight in your MS application. I can say, you will get plenty of opportunities in BITS to improve your profile if you want to go for MS/MBA. If you want to go for GATE then its your CGPA and subject knowledge that will matter. So yeah, take these things into account as well. Think with a calm, composed and peaceful mind, about your future 5–6 years from now on. What do you want to do and what is it that you like the most. Finally, consult with your mom and dad. Take their opinion into account. They know whats best for you.

I was also in the same situation last year and I chose BITS Pilani Hyderabad campus and here are the reasons. Coming to the question directly, the new iits can be divided into 2 categories , 2008 one's and 2016 one's. All of them are new relative to many good colleges but they have the iit tag with them, so people tend to get confused because of it. Category 1- iits of 2008 include iit Hyderabad, iit gandhinagar, iit jodhpur etc. Out of them only iit Hyderabad has achieved good the name to be comparable to the rest iits but only for CS branch, they have various hackathon, fests and other events constantly increasing the students potential, all this because of it's location, it's located in the it hub of India, so yes iit Hyderabad has developed good infrastructure since last 8 years but still it lacks a lot in terms of other things like research, core placements etc. Now coming to other iits in this category, iits like iit gandhinagar, iit jodhpur, etc were established in 2008 and their state is much more poor then what a person might expect from a college with that tag and that caliber. Some of them haven't yet made a strong alumni network , none popular tech fests or events, they don't have facilities like ecell , some of them don't have well functioning robotics clubs, programming clubs etc, they haven't made a good placement division also. So many key important things are lacking which you may not find huge but are really important for your development in the college days. 2016 iits- these iits are really in a bad state, none of them has still had a graduating batch , so no alumni network as of now, they are still trying to teach students in other colleges because the campuses aren't ready as of yet for some of them, no infrastructure for clubs and associations which can help you progress and give you a taste of practical knowledge outside labs and classes, and that's very important. Also no experienced teacher, performing research tasks , so no research driven students also. This all creates a very bookish and dull environment all across the college. BITS- it is an old college with 3 campuses , pilani , Goa and Hyderabad which in total are called BITS pilani. The pilani campus is a really old campus with great alumni network spread across the globe , I personally know 3 students who just got into Harvard , MIT and Microsoft in this year. Thus, this can show you how vast our alumni has spread , and it will only grow from here. Pilani campus cs is comparable to top 5 iits and iiit Hyderabad, whereas Goa and Hyderabad, relatively new are comparable to top 7 iits. But , the faculty here is really experienced and are from top renowned colleges from India as well as from international colleges. We have many tech clubs and associations here, ranging from finance , management to physics, robotics etc. Covering the whole array of knowledge pools . A well established and functional ecell is present in all three colleges, we have space exploration and development clubs etc. We have fests like quark, Atmos ( tech fest) : spree, bosm and arena (sports fests) : oasis, pearl and waves( cultural fests). For cs here , we have coding clubs, tech assocs , labs open to all etc making you intensely fluent and knowledgable in that domain. Even our core branches have that facility, like robotics and automation club, aero club , Vulcan( car development club) etc. Everyone here creates things , everyone here learns things , not just bookish too. Life here is super chill with policies like 0% attendence, make your own timetable , no dress code etc. All this helps you explore your own interest and helps you develop them without any unnecessary burden of attendance. Keeping the fees part aside , BITS gives the best knowledge to future engineers and it is a pedestal which one can never ignore. Placement division is well functioning, with around 47% companies coming for core placements and the rest for it. Thus showing, how BITS produces students with great practical knowledge which companies find really good for them. Average placement in BITS tend to lie between 10–12 lacks and for CSE it lies between 17–20 lacks across all campuses. Thus here ROI is also good. Thus, all these are the difference between new iits and bits pilani. Read them carefully and take a wise decision, and if you come to BITS, you won't regret it ever. All the best for the future.

Let me give you the reasons. First of all, BITS Pilani is comparable to top 7 iits and iiit Hyderabad. Also , it has a alumni network unparalleled which is spread across the globe and is helpful for your future endeavors be it jobs or further education. Also we have various technical clubs and association like aero club, space exploration , ecell, Vulcan (car designing and manufacturing club) etc, all these help you get practical knowledge from among your peers and helps you get practical knowledge which you deserve and require for placement. We have coding club, robotics club which helps create future innovation. The life at BITS is super chill also, no dress code, 0% attendence policy , no hostel in times etc. All these help you to focus on stuff you require over unnecessary stuff like attendence and helps you grow and pursue you passion and interest out of the 4 walls of class. Also the placement over here are much better than PEC , the average here is 10–12 lacs , for it sector it's 15–16 Lacs and for CSE it's around 18–20 Lacs , so if you think that the fees will make a dent in your pocket don't worry , you'll recover it in not more than 2 years. Also we have various scholarship which helps people to decrease the load they have. No reservations for any categories means you'll study among top students from all across India and learn from them and progress with them. So your peers will be meritorious and polished. Thus , don't just look into the placement and look at the bigger picture, BITS is for overall development. And that's why BITS reigns supreme over many Indian colleges and most definitely over PEC.

Placement:- this is the major difference between the non- core branches and cse. See not everyone in iits get placed also. There are cases not getting placed after being from an iit, most of them are from these branches. Also , if they get placed , their starting salary won't be more than 4–5 lacs and if he/she goes for IT sector than it would be better if he did cse from BITS. So, unless you have key interest in those fields than take them , your interest will surely make you capable, but if you don't then take cse at BITS, as it is secure and reliable. Think from your side as well, a tag is just a tag at the end , it's you who has to look all the factors and see above just mere tags and look into the future prospects of the course.

Long Answer: It completely depends on your preferences regarding the field you want to build your career in. There are a huge number of electives available in BITS that can help you score a better job than a person who'd apply without such specialized courses. Let me give you several examples: Core Placements : I know seniors who scored amazing internships, placements and MS admits because of their Formal Projects that they took as electives. I'm also aware of several seniors who got placed in good companies by completing a numbers of relatively advanced electives meant for ME students.Finance Placements : BITS offers an option of several minor degree programmes alongside your BE/MSc degree, one popular option of which is the Finance Minor. It will enable you to sit for some pretty high paying Finance related jobs during the placements season. This one has become a pretty common option for students who are more interested in Finance and Economics than their core engineering branch.Management and Non Tech Placements: There are several electives available which might help you secure a good non tech job in a management position. This option is also one that's widely used in BITS as a career pathway. I just heard about a friend of one of my seniors who got a 17 Lpa offer from Swiggy in a non tech role (just an example)IT Placements for Non CSE People : This is a very popular option for people in core branches and circuits branches like EEE and ENI. You can take up CSE courses as electives and be able to sit in placements for *some* IT firms that allow non IT people to sit for placements. (NOTE : This option is actually pretty tought to get anything good out of as for most companies you'll be competing with people who have dedicated degrees in CSE)MS Opportunities : You can pick up electives and minors like Data Science or Materials Science electives to secure a good project which in turn might help you a lot when it comes to your MS applications.For any other queries you can personally message me on Messenger.

Physics, Math, Chemistry and Biological Sciences are even more demanding, mostly in that order, descending. Also CS is difficult to get. The CGPA requirements are high. Most of the people end up in one of the Electronics branch. In that case, say bye to everything you hold dear. ECE, EEE and EI are so work load heavy branches that coupled with MSc courses, you'll simply die. Best to take some normal BE course.

ECE, EEE, ENI have the majority of their courses identical and have a difference of mere 3 courses that come in final semester of 3rd year.

My opinion would be BITS pilani EEE. Civil is not much in demand. Roorkee is fine college. If you want to get into coding, you can opt roorkee and get place in IT, same with BITS pilani. EEE as core is also not much in demand. Electronics is very high in demand. You can get good core jobs in ece but difficult to find one in EEE where people are working on something current. EEE is fine if you are inclined towards technology, learn some coding or do robotics. you have very high chances of good MS and PHD if you want to do that. From EEE its easy to go into IT because they do involve some programming. I think the real question here is about civil vs EEE. Both BITS and ROORkee are fine. Civil in roorkee is good but then civil is in very less demand unless you plan to do further studies and build something like very big and magnificent.

I have completed my second year at NITT and have met loads of people from different colleges (IIT’s, BITS and even universities abroad) during my internships and other engagements. One thing I can assure you, buddy, “the environment in which you live, and the people with whom you interact have a long-lasting, indelible effect on your personality”. With regards to your question, there’s no doubt BITS Pilani is comparable to IIT’s (if not better than them, the TOP 7). And a college like BITS ( very specific of Pilani campus ) is obviously a commonplace of like-minded intelligent people who foster each other’s growth coherently. Although BITS Hyderabad and Goa have a good set of people (and I don’t doubt it), you, assuming that you being a normal person and not an exceptional talent, will grow in a more competitive environment, an environment where you’ll feel uncomfortable— because then only you’ll actually grow. Colleges or environments which will make you feel comfortable, where you’ll top easily and feel proud about your “exceptional achievements” are detrimental for your better future. And it's true, my friend. Long talk short, if you have an option of BITS Pilani not so preferred branch and BITS Goa (ECE, EEE and the rest), choose Pilani, unless you’re intentionally biased about a particular branch ( which you shouldn't be, because there’s so much in college that people taking admission don’t have any idea about). Pilani has a really good environment as compared to the other 2 campuses, and that really matters than your department as such. Your department obviously matters, but that’s the case there, in college. Moreover, exceptions are there. There are people earning B.Tech from “not-so-famous” colleges who have done exceptionally well as those in the “conventionally famous colleges”; and in many cases even better than them. One more point— If you are really passionate about ECE on some knowledge which you might have gained, then you can think of Goa as well. I am not saying that Goa is bad. The point is whether you want to live in a comfortable, easy-to-go environment and live a good life ( which you’ll get, not a doubt ), or you want to face problems and issues, face failures and heartbreaks, growing as a complete individual and then taste success, which will obviously be long-lasting… P.S.- I am writing this because I have my friends in BITS Goa, and in Pilani campus too who did the Eco course there. And my bias towards the latter is due to the information I have gained from them as well as my own experiences. Choose wisely. Enjoy :) If you liked the answer, do upvote and like it.

For example, in mechanical engineering (my branch) the second year weekly schedule of evaluative components (graded) was something like this : Monday : One evaluative CAD Lab Assignemnt Tuesday : One evaluative tutorial test (machine design ) Wednesday : no fixed evaluative component but surprise tests in lectures could be there Thursday : One evaluative Production Tech Lab Friday : One tutorial test (IC engines ) Saturday : Two tutorial tests (KDM and Production Techniques) As you can see, this schedule kept most of my branch mates on their toes for the whole semester. Sunday is a much required breather for us, but other than that the schedule was somewhat hectic. Now, the above mentioned schedule is a rather bad one when compared to the schedules of some other branches in campus like CSE, in terms of weekly evaluative components and evaluative labs, at least that's what I've observed as half of my wingies are CSE students and the other half are Mech students .

I can speak for BE CS in Pilani campus. For the CS department, from personal experience, I can say that the reality is more or less similar to what it seems.

Hardly any of the courses have any marks related to attendance, and you don't get into trouble for not attending lectures (barring maybe issues with understanding the subject, if you didn't study back in your hostel either). In a handful of courses, there might be tests in the lectures but they are always announced. (this is quite different from a lot other departments which have surprise tests in the lectures, and the instructors actively take attendance instead of just passing around the attendance sheet like in CS lectures)Tutorials have a smaller class capacity, so here, it is common to see instructors actively taking attendance. But only a handful of CS courses have tutorials. Here again, all tests are announced (unlike other departments, where almost all tutorial tests are unannounced, albeit predictable).A good number of CS courses have labs. Now here, attendance is generally taken at the end of the lab, where your daily tasks are checked and graded by the lab instructor. If this is not the case, then as an alternative, a short quiz is organized at the end of the lab. Although the total weightage of the lab tasks/lab quizzes aren't generally more than 2-5%. But attending labs make it a hell lot easier to ace the end semester lab test.While all these seem good to a LITE student, it is always a good practice to attend the lectures, since one of the easier ways towards getting into a professor's good books is regular attendance. This is required if you want to do a good project under a professor who is high in demand. The absence of any minimum attendance policy is to provide independence to the students to focus on their interests and develop their skillsets in the time they make for themselves…you are not supposed to skip every class altogether and somehow scrape through the exams; it'll do you more harm than good.

Talking about placements, it completely depends on what you're planning to pursue. It has always been a notion that the placements are not good in core disciplines, but the reality is that lot of students in the core branches digress to different fields, for which they develop an interest over the course of college. Which is perfectly fine, and which allows me to tell you to not worry about placements per se if you don't have any preference for branch, as you can develop a new interest in anything and pursue that.

As far as the curriculum goes, the courses are spread out over a variety of subtopics ranging from the physics of semiconductors to machines and drives and from signal processing to theoretical concepts such as coding theory.

That said though, the courses offer more than just an insight into the field, and a few (Communication Systems, for instance) take quite a challenging look at key concepts and ideas. Overall, one might find coursework slightly voluminous and time-consuming, but I believe it's worth the investment, for the light it sheds on one's future specialization. Something I personally wish to add is that the populist notion in BITS that the ECE curriculum is hard and tough to score in, is a farce and it resembles just about any other stream in terms of complexity. BITS offer very nice industrial exposure and also top companies like NVIDIA, INTEL,SAMSUNG, XILINX recruit engineer from bits Hyderabad. But, remember you need to to have good grasp of core subjects of ECE and also you need to be good in programming and also you must focus on data structures and algorithms. BITS tag only gives you chance to attend the interviews hosted by top companies like NVIDIA, INTEL,SAMSUNG, XILINX . But, at the end cracking these interviews depends on the skills that you must acquire during your first 3 years of stay in BITS hyderabad.

The counselling was held in the Lecture Hall Complex in the biggest lecture hall called L-7. It was pretty hot in Kanpur, and when I entered the lecture hall, the first thing that hit me was the full blast of the AC. In those days AC was quite uncommon and for someone from a not so well-off family like myself, it was quite a treat. I was impressed! I was going to study in air-conditioned classes for next four years, or so I thought. However, IITK flattered only to deceive, and not for the last time. For the next four years I never saw the AC switched on for any class in L-7. Some IITK prof running the counselling must have had a sharp marketing brain. Then came the time to fill our college and ‘branch’ preferences. It was a straightforward business. Just fill up a paper form and submit, and you will be informed within a few days which branch you are allotted. Most of us opted for branches strictly as per JEE rank, and I was no exception. Since I did not have a good enough rank for Computer Science, I could have comfortably gotten Electrical Engg at any IIT. However, I had some fancy for IIT Madras (I don’t know why). So I filled IIT Madras Computer Science and Electronics Engg first. Only then I put IITK CS and EE. When I went to submit the form, Prof PK Chatterji saw the form. He asked my dad, “Do you have a quarrel with your son? Why are you sending him to Madras? He will easily get Electrical Engg at IITK. This is the best EE program. Now go and change the branch to IITK EE and submit”. To be honest, he did not advise or counsel me — basically his tone was, “Don’t be stupid. Now just go and fill up IITK and submit the form.” Even though I did nothing great at IITK, I am thankful to Prof Chatterji for helping me choose IITK. So pretty much that was my ‘counselling’. Nowadays, I am told it is a 7 round process like a Chakravyuh. And you need to run predictive optimization algorithms to get the best possible branch :) That is the price you pay for internet access!

At least in my times (not too long ago), all the hostel blocks were identical to the point of getting confused which one of them one was in. Right now, the new Bhavans—Valmiki and the other one, the name of which I forget—are quite swanky, but the rooms within are shared by two people, in contrast to the single occupancy rooms of the older Bhavans. So if you value your privacy, I wouldn’t say the new blocks are the best choice. Now at the start of your second year, you get the option of moving into one of two Bhavans (the identities of which will be known only during the allocation process), with the wing-mates of your choice. Of course, as one can anticipate, there will be a lot of jostling for the better-ventilated corridors, and the wings served by better toilets—more of the latter than the former, actually. So if you’re lucky (as my wingies and I were), you get the choicest wings that overlook the road outside, and into which the rain slants, during the inevitable hailstorm days. My word of advice, hence, will be to get in a wing with someone with considerable clout, who can ensure your remaining years in BITS stay sunny.

On the other hand if you ask a dual degree guy, he'd always have his experience in the back of his mind while answer every single question. Reading forward is your choice.  Yeah, so a 5 Year course gives you a Msc. + B.E. at BITS Pilani. Pattern of a Dual Degree : 1st Year : Same for every Fresher. On the basis of CGPA, you'd get your B.E. 2nd year : Study MSc (4+4 core courses each semester) degree + 2–3 Electives. 3rd Year : MSc ( 3+3 core courses each semester) degree + B.E. ( 4+4 core courses each semester) degree + Maybe 1 Elective 4th year : B.E. (3+3 core courses each semester) degree + 3–4 Electives. 5th year : Practice School each semester.  The above pattern changes with people opting for semi thesis and at other cases.  Tough parts : Your first year would be just similar to any other kid of your batch. But you'd have a pressure to stand in top 20% of the dualites to get CS (mostly, why you take dual degree ) and that affects the fresher year at college for a few dualites.Your third year would be toughest time of college. Taking a worse case, say you get to do Msc Maths + B.E. Eee and you don't like doing it, this year you'd feel a lot sorry about whatever's going on.You can not get a back in any course. A no of times its a pre-requisite for another course, which leads to sem backs and year backs and those troubles would be harsh.Very specific case : Now if you get any kinda disciplinary action semback or medical reason sem-off, its always a year back for dualites.Now, 250+ students join each campus every year and most of them 90+% pass out with two degrees in five years itself. Few go on for doing single degree, dropping the rest and very very few get into above mentioned cases.  Good parts : Your second year would not be very tough with sometimes people finding there Msc courses easy and scoring and they take out time for other stuff too.You'd have 2 6-month PS in your graduation, Which is a great thing. Firstly, it helps your GPA a lot, secondly, it helps you with longer work experience and gets double chances of PPOs too.Its kinda 4-year time at college camous plus 2-six month Internship, giving you two degrees.MOST IMPORTANTLY, YOU TAKE THIS CHANCE TO PERFORM IN FIRST YEAR AND TAKE “CS” AS THE BRANCH.20–25% OF FRESHER DUALITES GET CSE.  Points to be noted: There are students getting Chemical after First year, who took eco leaving ENI/EEE/ECE in the first place , and many aren't happy with that.There are students taking CSE, who got the admission in Msc Bio in the last iteration, last call. Decide yourself. Dual degree : Its not very hard. Its not very easy either. Its … ummm.. its College. You'll know.

I’m assuming you’re talking about the first year from your question … Most of the students that get into the dual degree program aim to get CSE as their dual- for which you need consistency in the efforts you place in your studies. There are mainly three types of people among the dualites The ones who study all the timeThe ones who study and enjoy the campus lifeThe ones who only enjoy campus lifeNow to be very honest the dualites mainly come under the first category but there are many instances where people get good grades and also actively participate in extra curricular activities. Although in my opinion it’s tough to maintain a fine line between studies and leisure time but you can find many people who strike a great balance between the two. Getting into a dual degree DOES NOT mean studying 24X7 and you can enjoy the campus life as well. In the initial months I used to play badminton in the evenings and study for some time daily. The third year does get a little hectic though as you have to do courses from both your degrees so you don’t get much leisure time in your third year afaik. Remember one thing - consistency is KEY If you want to get good grades. So the bottom line is - you do get to enjoy the campus life but you should also try to be consistent as much as possible in your studies. Hope the answer helped.

M. Sc. Economics with CSE is the best combination out of all the options, mentioned above. And with some focused study, it may be possible to secure the required CGPA to get CSE as engineering branch. But, selecting a dual degree option, leaving aside ECE at Goa/ Hyderabad campus or EEE/ E&I/ Mechanical at Pilani campus, involves risk in the sense, that, if you cannot secure the required CGPA for getting CSE, again you will end up with a dual degree with some other engineering degree. So, if you are determined and very confident of securing the required CGPA, then only take 5th or 6th option, as mentioned above. This is not a very tough task also. Otherwise, take any option from among serial number 1 to 4. They have been placed in the order of their merit. ECE is also a very good branch and at present, it is considered as the 2nd preferred branch after CSE. So, select ECE at Goa & Hyderabad campus, if you are interested for a good branch ( option -1 / 2 above ). BITS Pilani, Pilani campus has the reputation of one of the best institutes in India and is regarded after the top 5 IITs. So, if you want to take a degree from Pilani campus, go for EEE or E&I ( option -3 above ). By selecting a 4 year degree course ( Sl no 1 to 4 above ), there is a chance of vertical shifting to CSE degree. But, for this, the required CGPA, at the end of 2nd semester goes as high as 9.6 to 9.7 in all the three campuses. But, securing this much CGPA is a tough task. All the points mentioned above are my personal views, without any prejudice. Finally, you have to take a conscientious decision by applying your own judgement. I wish you all the best.

Nearest city is Delhi that is anout 300Km.Hot weather at pilani , it goes even around 45 degress in Summer.

There are pros and cons of the dual program that’s being offered at BITS . I’ll try my best to discuss them one by one … PROS You get another chance to aim for the BE degree you weren’t able to get with your BITSAT score . To be very frank - most people take this option to aim for CS …You get your entire 5th year for Thesis / Practice School which is basically like your internship but for a longer duration than the students admitted in the single degree program . They get it for 6 months …If you are genuinely interested in pure science subjects it’s a great option for you . Most of the professors have doctorates in their respective fields and it gives you a wide range of profs to work under a project with them .CONS You have to study one extra year and this have to pay one year extra fees as compared to the single degree 4 year courseI wouldn’t personally consider this point in a con but you have to work quite harder than the rest of the students to get a good CGPA so as to get the dual degree you want ( as I mentioned earlier - above 90% target CSE) …The third year of your stay at college gets really hectic and it can be a burden on students.As for your question - is it worth it or not; it solely depends on you to be very frank. If you are willing to work diligently in your first year and score a good CGPA - you’ll end up with a good dual degree which is always worth it as it is from a BITS campus rather than other private colleges…. Hope I’ve been of somewhat help to clear your confusion .

I emphasized on focussing more on the stream then the college brand name as in many colleges, companies have eligibility criteria i.e CSE/IT students can apply but others cant and so other students are not exposed to enough opportunity as this is the case in the college I did my undergrad from and in many other colleges. I have close friends in top-notch firms where the intern from BITS Pilani could not convert to FTE but students from averages colleges like VIT or Manipal got promoted within a year.

I am saying this for Pilani campus‌. I think it holds true for Goa and Hyderabad as well. The question is unclear that whether you are referring to MSc course exclusively or as a part of dual degree program? Students of Integrated MSc course with Engineering( Dual degree students) has the same placements as the single degree ones with a few exceptions. The Students who are exclusively enrolled in the MSc course can get Non core jobs in the companies where they are eligible. In addition to this, there are a few opportunities available depending on the MSc branch taken. People with MSc in economics can make a promising career in Finance. One of my batchmate was placed in JP Morgan. People with an MSc in mathematics get edge over others in Analytics companies. I don't think there is any other companies coming exclusively for MSc people namely for Physics, Chemistry and Bio except I remember Reckitt Benckiser were selecting people from MSc chemistry for Summer internship. So one may get privilege in such type of companies. Most of the people who enter into BITS through BITSAT , opt for dual degree program. They mainly rely on their respective Engineering disciplines for placements. In any case, most of the jobs in Analytics , Consulting and IT( except the likes of Uber, Nutanix etc) sector are open to all. For instance, one student got Civil engineering in dual after stellar performance ( sarcasm intended) in his first year, he dropped the dual after 2–1, continued with his MSc programme and did coding for the next two years. He got placed with a 12 LPA package. Thank you. ",0.18225555555555556,Positive,3.3645111111111112,0.029239766081871343,1,4.364511111111112

In fact, even today many people aren't aware of this and many do feel that this is something not as good as B-Tech so I just thought I could spread a word regarding all that matters is what you know and a stroke of luck obviously.

I have close friends in top-notch firms where the intern from BITS Pilani could not convert to FTE but students from averages colleges like VIT or Manipal got promoted within a year. Also, we have witnessed people from the Non-CSE background who become really great coders and bagged great packages from BITS with a Non-IT background so it's basically all that you do to get what you want.

Note: Trust me when I say that, dual degree won't be so easy as it seems to be since you will have enough disturbances diverting you from studies and also do consider you will have to study a degree for 5 years when all your friends will have already got placed in some firm or the other including the expenses incurred for that one extra year. Also, the work load for a dual degree is pretty much high as you will have to manage two degrees at the same time hence you wont have much time to invest into other fields. A dual degree will also restrict you from taking any minor courses as it is not advised to burden yourself with more courses than the pre-existing ones.

One can't really predict the cutoff very accurately. There is a lot of criterion to be considered to estimate it. The only assertion I can make which might only be close to accurate is that the general consensus of this year's JEE Mains was quite bad and low scoring. So I can probably guess that the cutoff might increase because more students might apply for BITS this year. Last year's cutoff for CSE at BITS HYDERABAD was 334. I would still ask you to go for counseling and hope to get it. Because there were around 6 iterations for 2018 I would ask you to have some other options as well don't put all your stakes at BITS You might probably have a greater chance at getting ECE there Good luck . ,0.1144375,Positive,3.228875,0.05263157894736842,1,4.228875

In fact there are some colleges that pay you stipend for pursuing a course in natural sciences because they want to attract good students towards such courses who eventually will pursue PhD and help the college or university gets its name and fame. I'd advice if this is the case as mentioned in the question that one must first meet people who are already studying there. For judging any college or campus, visiting the place and meeting the students already pursuing the course. Students might give you their motivation for doing so and so course. I believe that BITS might be offering somewhat more on this and only due to that they had to kept the fees as mentioned in the question. If money is really a detractor in this case, which I guess might be the case for any person, then I'd suggest to look for other options in government colleges and universities. Post grad courses in natural sciences like physics, chemistry etc. are available in numerous universities across the country. Starting from IIT to any other state run university. For IIT you need to appear for JOINT ADMISSION TEST, JAM for which forms will be filled next year now. For other universities including Hyderabad University admissions might be in process as still a month is left for academic year to start. If Hyderabad BITS is offering you things like foreign tour, international exposure and other fancy things in their degree then definitely you can have it as an option, if they are offering a degree just like any other university in the country, better visit there and get to know what might be reason.

The 6 month internship is allocated to all the students irrespective of CGPA, Branch(Sometimes) and Campus and hence it forms a good opportunity for all the students.

You get offers through summer internship/campus placement or 6 month internship ( alias Practice School 2 ❤️). Sometimes even multiple offers. Few top companies are Adobe,DE Shaw, Microsoft, Google, Nutanix, Apple. In the near future all the three campuses will converge in terms of IT and Phoenix Placements. Few of the companies allow CS and Phoenix Branches but about 50% of IT Recruiters allow all the Engineering students. For Phoenix aka ECE/EEE/ENI : The average package is about 12 LPA. You have top companies like Nvidia, Qualcomm, Intel, Texas Instruments, Samsung. The opportunities are limited to only these branches and generally the companies have a eligibility cutoff of 7CGPA. Again the mode of recruitment is through Campus Placements/summer internship/ 6 month internship. For Mechanical Sector: The Average package offered is around 5.5LPA. The top companies are Nestle, Forbes Marshall, Bombardier,Tata Motors, John Deere, SKF. THE mode of recruitment is majorly through Campus Placements/6 month internship. In view of Placements in Mechanical Sector the Pilani Campus used to be a lot ahead but both the other campuses are catching up real good. For Civil Sector: The Average package is 5.5LPA and the major recruiters are L&T, Thornton Tomasetti, BSCPL, Amara Raja Group and Ramboll. Mode of recruitment is majorly through Campus Placements. The Placements are similar in both Hyderabad and Pilani Campus, Goa Campus doesn't have Civil . For Chemical Sector: The Average package is 5.5LPA and major recruiters are Reliance, AirLiqude, Aequs and Hindustan Unilever. For Consulting/Analytics(Non Tech) : The Average package is around 9LPA and there are too Companies like Flipkart, McKinsey, Thorogood,Deloitte, ZS Associates,Indus Insights, Amazon, Zomato etc. The major mode of recruitment is through Campus Placements/6 Month Internship. The opportunities are open to all branches but require a decent CGPA of 6. Other Campuses have been trying to catch up with Pilani. For Finance Sector: This is the major area where BITS can compete with the legacy IITs and is better than all the new IITs and NITs. The average package is around 11LPA and the major mode of recruitment is through Practice School ❤️ (6 Month Internship). The top companies are JP Morgan, Credit Suisse, MSCI, Nomura and Morningstar.

A Dean's son missed admission by 1 mark and took admission in some other college.BITS provides the facility of 2 internships to each and every student, one after 2nd year completion of 2 months and other in 4th year of 6 months. You get a chance to work at companies like Nvidia, Samsung which gives package of more than 15 lacs. Mostly people get a PPO(Pre placement offer) there.BITS ensures an overall development of personality rather than focusing on one aspect, forgetting others which most of the colleges in India does.Last but not the least, recently it became Institute of Eminence which added cherries to its glory.BITS is unique piece out of all.

The first batch got graduated in 2016 . Everyone got full time offer from companies like samsung qualcomm , bydesign . Students of first batch faced lot of problems for placements but in the end all got placed. 3.) The next batch 2015–2017 again everyone got full time offers and some new companies like IBM labs , Mediatek got added in the recruiter list. 4.) My batch 2016–2018 again everyone got full time offers and further new companies like western digital,synopsys, TCS R&D , Mathworks got added in the recruiter list 5.) 2017–2019 Right now 95% of the students are placed and i am sure the rest 5% will also be getting full time offers before the convocation. IIITB has now around 8–9 regular recruiters like Qualcomm , Mediatek , Samsung , IBM , Synopsys , Mathworks , Western Digital , TCS R&D etc and every year some new companies are also coming. So the point is because of amazing faculties,academic environment and hardworking students companies are showing confidence in IIITB. So may be this is the reason for increase in cutoff.

In my experience, biology research is absolutely booming globally today. I personally know people who are actually formally trained in either of Physics/Chemistry/Math/Computers and still are active researchers in Biology. I personally am a physics and computer science dualite, and yet I've primarily worked in biology as well. There are two main reasons for this. One, there is a huge amount of funding available in India and abroad for Bio research. Two, bio is a relatively unexplored field, but this has been changing only recently with the development of technology in other fields, like computer science and nano technology. Coming to BITS Pilani, if I speak of the Pilani campus (as that's the only campus I can personally vouch for) the Bio department faculty is one of the best, if not the best among all the departments in the campus. I feel this holds true in the Goa and Hyd campus as well, given my interactions with people from there. The bio course structure is also unlike what we perceive it to be based on our experience with it in high school. There is less of rote learning and much more emphasis on the concepts. The bio coursework is among the lightest in all MSc disciplines. The real advantage in BITS is the dual degree. Your additional knowledge of a field like computer science or electronics or mechanical engineering would give you a tremendous advantage as a researcher, since most of the bio research is inter-disciplinary nowadays, where tools from other disciplines are being used to uncover previously untapped areas of biology. If, however, you are only interested in pure biology, BITS is still a pretty solid option, but you'd probably be better off joining some IISER or NISER like institute, where the degree will be of 5 years, instead of the 4 years in BITS (if you do not take a dual, then a BITS MSc would take 4 years). Their degree would be more rigorous and their course structure has compulsory publication requirements and such, which help accelerate a career in research. But if you do intend to do a dual degree from BITS (which in my opinion is a better option, because then you always have the option to go into engineering if you don't like research), then it's definitely an amazing choice. Hope this helps. All the best. ",0.3002518518518518,Positive,3.6005037037037035,0.017543859649122806,0,3.6005037037037035

The cutoff for this transfer goes around 9.6 CGPA. The criteria is that you have to be within the top 5 students of the branch to get it. Since CS students are usually the smartest, they score the highest, and so it's difficult to get the required CGPA. Meanwhile, for science students with dual degrees, to choose their 2nd degree of CS, the score is manageable with cutoff being around 8.2 CGPA in Pilani campus. It's best that you don't take a branch at BITS just to do a transfer, after first year. It's much harder than IITs for a branch change.

The kind of investment and innovations coming in the privately held institutions across India and active international collaborations with aspirations to crack into the world rankings, govt institutions (IIT/NIT) may see brand erosion in next 8–10 years, until unless they also start using IIM model of self funding and stay relevant leaders (IIMs faced challenge from ISB just because of political compulsions and delay in change of funding patterns). BITS and other leading private institutions gets a big advantage in terms of future roadmaps. In summary, If you get a chance to study at BITS, there cannot be a reason to go wrong with the decision.More so as you will not be working in past but future, which is definitely brighter than it looks today. Ultimately, your placement can be as good as you are. There are instances where, people outside top 10 has got better placements than tier one IIT during campus placements.

This segment focuses on the percentage girl students, percentage of backward classes, percentage of students from other states. However, the score BITS got is due to the students being from different states and also due to the foreign students.Perception : This is decided on two things - First is the Application to seat ratio. It depends on Number of students applied to a specific course and number of students who offered that course. Second, is the rating which is by Govt funding agencies, institution heads, HR employers, NGO etcThe only area due to which ranking is affected badly is “Research and Professional practice”. This depends highly on the number of research articles published and the amount of work being done on research. Usually, most of the research work is carried out by M.Tech and Ph.d students. The number of patents filed are pretty low in BITS because of very low strength in M.Tech and Ph.d programs. So, the number of projects they work on are also less. However, BITS needs to improve a lot in research related activities. The administration is working towards that. Although, research part is lagging when it comes to B.Tech, BITS stands way ahead of many colleges which are ranked better in NIRF. Please correct me if there are any mistakes. Thank You..!!!

The little ice age was a drop of less than 1 degree globally and that lead to frosts and poor harvests and has been attributed to the French revolution. Modern climate change (less than a degree so far) has been associated to the drought in Syria and may have played a role in the Syrian civil war. 1 degree is a global average, it can have a bigger effect locally. That’s not to say that France couldn’t have had a poor growing season without the little ice age or that Syria’s drought was caused by man made climate change, but in both cases, the climate changes made it worse. Likewise, the warmer oceans likely made hurricane Sandy worse. So there are effects, even at “just a single degree”, maybe not every year, but often enough. Something else to keep in mind is that the 1 degree isn’t uniform. Oceans warm much slower. Surface temperature over oceans has risen about 0.1 maybe 0.2 degrees as a result of climate change. Over land, the average is well over 1 degree C of warming so far and in some locations, 4–5 degrees C. Alaska has warmed more than most, and the warming so far - which is usually estimated at about 0.8 C so far, has lead to melting roads and loss of sea ice, as a result, polar bears are looking for food in towns. Another thing to keep in mind is that 1 degree is all it takes to melt ice and warm and rise oceans. Oceans take a long time to heat up, so 1 degree of warming wouldn’t melt glaciers quickly, but over time it could lead to a foot or even several feet of sea level rise. Glaciers are in equilibrium and “just 1 degree” can change that equilibrium significantly. The last ice age was just 4 1/2 degrees Celsius colder by most estimates, and sea level was over 100 feet lower. Small changes in temperature can lead to big changes in glacial mass over enough time. A lot of the “how bad” question depends on the “how soon” question. 1 degree is enough to cause problems. 2 degrees is considered a danger point by the IPCC and we could see that by around 2050.

Because the amount of damage a storm does tends to increase *exponentially* with its wind speed and storm surge, this increase is not a joke. It can turn a rainy indoors weekend into a major disaster.Rainfall patterns change substantially — This is a winners and losers sort of thing, but mostly you lose. Some areas that were arid may become wet, and some that were wet may become dry, or areas may take their current trend to a further extreme, with an already dry area becoming desertified, or a wet area suffering yearly catastrophic flooding. Unfortunately, every society on Earth has customs, industries, and infrastructure designed around what their existing climate has been, so significant changes to that climate is always disruptive, expensive, and usually painful for everyone involved.Edge regions become uninhabitable - There are many areas of the planet that are frankly only barely inhabitable by humans. 70% of the planet is covered with water and uninhabitable, obviously. Extremely arid or hot regions, regions at very low elevation next to the water are often marginally inhabitable at best. The truth is, a LOT of our total land area is technically not ideal for human habitation - and climate change looks likely to render a substantial percentage of the equatorial regions less habitable, or uninhabitable without major infrastructure support that is not forthcoming. Imagine a substantial increase in the yearly heat and intensity of monsoon seasons for massively crowded and relatively poor countries like India and Pakistan, for example, and the vast migrant crises that would arise for the rest of the planet if a substantial percentage of over 1 billion people started trying to move northwards due to major crop failures there.

It's like asking for a Pizza and recieving it but you've to pay for the water the restaurant needs, the vegetables they needed. Well this was supposed to be arranged by the restaurant itself right? But the restaurant is managed by business man such as Birla. They'll milk out your dad's money and the comfort out his life. Churn his hard money to procure more teachers? Nah because we're still short staffed. Then probably to improve the technology and quality for education here? Lmfao we've stopped hoping for that here. To increase infra? Well yes they're doing that to be honest, I'm not all against them. I'm a BITSian and this is what I've for you based on the greediness of the college for money.

I have barely met anyone who comes from a village or small town( A friend was from a small town but than he did his 6th upto 12th in Kota so not exactly from small town).Predominantly English Educated:- Almost everyone in BITS has studied in a English Medium school. And plenty of us, have studied in the various DPSs’,KVs,DAVs etc and have got coaching in FIITJEE,Allen,Bansal,Chaitanya-Naryana etc. Some of my friends have also studied in schools like Don Bosco,John-Connon etc. Some of my friends even had offers from foreign universities but decided to stay back in India for their Undergrad.Family Income/assets:- I can’t give you an exact number of what the average family income will be but calculating it will be stupid. For example a friend of my father is an IAS officer who earns 15 lakhs where as my father is an IT manager in Bangalore earning around 25 to 30 lakhs(Standard salary of a IT employee with 15 year work experience in a top MNC). Yet the IAS officer is better off due to the additional perks which they get. Plus some of my friends have got dual earners i.e both their parents earn and hence their income is in excess of 50 lakhs. So rather than answering what the family income will be I will just give you a brief overview of how many students can afford the BITS fees (which is around 4–5 lakh per year), around 30% of my batchmates have taken student loan to study in BITS. So this essentially means that 70% of the students can afford the fees and 30 % can’t. Make up your mind with that data pointFinal Conclusion: Most BITSians ( atleast more than 50%) come from famliy background which can provide the 5 neccesties of life i.e. Ghar,Kapda,Roti,Internet connection and a good education(at least by Indian Standards). Now whether that makes us Upper Middle class,Ultra rich or Middle class is upto to the user to decide. ",0.29810500000000006,Positive,3.59621,0.04093567251461988,1,4.59621

The engineering field boomed in late 90s, India emerged as an service intensive industry and engineers were greatly paid. Today, parents still think that Engineering is the highest paying job. The country is saturated with mediocre engineers with the mushrooming of third grade institutes. Approximately, 1.2 million students appear for JEE. Only some 25,000 are able to make it to IITs and NITs with good majors (CSE, ME, EE) Where do the rest go? To private institutions like VIT, BITS, SRM and MAHE.

JEE, NEET, UGC, CLAT, DUJAT etc., Could be dissolved in it.Gao Kao Model: Let's abolish all entrance exams and divide our class 12 boards exams to different level of difficulties, so one doesn't have to prepare for entrance exams.

Seth Bhudarmal, one of the earliest ancestors of the Birla family, and a reputed businessman, settled down in Pilani.  (Source : Brushes With History ) Seth Shiv Narayan, Seth Bhudarmal’s great-grandson, established the institution as a small “Pathshala”(meaning school) in Pilani in 1901. It started with a single teacher, to teach his grandsons, Ghanshyam Das Birla and Rameshwar Das Birla. The Pathshala evolved slowly and steadily into a High School in 1925 and became an Intermediate College in 1929. The Birla Education Trust was founded in the same year. The Intermediate College developed into a Degree College in 1943. In 1947, this college was raised to postgraduate level. In 1950, Pharmacy courses were started in this college, and in 1952, it was bifurcated into College of Arts and the College of Science, Commerce and Pharmacy.  During World War II, the Government of India established a Technical Training Centre at Pilani for the supply of technicians for Defence Services and industry. In 1946, late Shri G.D. Birla decided to convert it into an engineering college with degree programmes in Electrical and Mechanical Engineering. Master's programme in Electronics was started in 1955. B.E. programmes in Civil Engineering and Chemical Engineering were started later. In 1964 with the inception of the Birla Institute of Technology and Science (BITS), the colleges, viz., Birla College of Science, Commerce and Pharmacy, Birla College of Arts and Birla College of Engineering situated at Pilani, as also all properties, movable and immovable, together with educational facilities, hostels, staff quarters, playgrounds, etc., became part of the Institute and all these properties were vested in it.

I assume that you would need the ‘experience’ to enrich your personality and shine in the outside world.

I don’t blame just the university but also the students who represent it equally. A good university comprise of good students who shape the culture of the university. If you are performing good in your college, there is a high likelihood of you getting a good job,and if you and your colleagues perform good in their career as well your companies will most likely hire more students from your college expecting similar results. However, it is the university’s responsibility to select students wisely. some colleges in hope of filling their seats gives admission to bad apples which in turn ruins their reputation, Also it is the university’s responsibility to provide what the student needs and listen to their demands and suggestions. It is all in their vision, Oxford, Harvard etc. would have far less students in any program than any other university you named, yet they are one of the best whereas many universities in India would simply prefer quantity over quality. its both the management and the student that shapes the reputation of an organisation.

IT is also a viable alternative for B.Tech and there isn't much difference in the syllabus or subjects, just the name of the degree tbh. Also, don't worry if you don't get into CSE in the KTR campus but get an option for OTHER campus - I would say go for it! I had a choice between both campuses and elected for KTR because the academics are great and I got to witness the growth of a campus in a tangible way before my own eyes.Plus, if you are really interested in CS as a career choice, you can continue to learn on your own time using resources from the internet such as codecademy, udemy, udacity, tutorialspoint - there is no shortage of resources there.Hope this satisfactorily answers your query.

You get to do a lot of fun activities in college such as playing sports, playing computer games on the LAN (CS/ NFS during my days, possibly PUBG these days), watching movies (you name the movie and you will find someone sharing it on the LAN), participating in Cultural Fests - Waves, Technical fests - Quark, Inter hostel festival-Zephyr, Sports festival - Spree. And not to forget the time spent at Sam’s coffee shop with friends interspersed with a few lectures here and there. And the opportunities for enjoying never ceases to run dry. Being a congregation of such a large number of students from every part of the country with such diverse cultural traits, your calendar is filled with festive dates. Be it Lohri of Punjab, Onam of Kerala or the Ugadi of Andhra Pradesh, you generally have a cultural program to organize or take part in. Not to mention the scale at which we celebrated the national festivals. I am firmly of the belief that these campus activities and avenues of enjoyment itself are enough to take home a box full of sweet memories. However, if that is not enough enjoyment, then you always have the evenings and Sundays to go around the state of Goa. A 15 minute drive to the nearest beach Bogmalo will ensure an evening well spent. Car & Bike Rentals without much of a fuss for travelling will ensure the explorer in you is satiated. There are innumerable Blogs & Vlogs to guide you going around the state. There are ample opportunities for water sports, trying out international cuisines or to simply bask in the sun and remain laid back. Now for the party animals, campus life in Goa has a lot to offer. Though enjoying night life was severely restrained by the college rules which had set a deadline to return to campus by 10:30 PM, we used to party inside hostels. At times, we would extend our stay in Goa (after leave is officially declared) to enjoy the nightlife and then get back home for the holidays. On certain occasions, we used to even organize parties for binge drinking at a collective level. So all these must amply explain the opportunities for enjoying in Goa.

I got cg of 9.44(I am a single degree student, so its not worth much except for bragging rights) by just going to most of the lectures and revising before exams. The important part is going to lectures and tutorials, if you go and listen carefully and you are not even required to make notes(i haven't fully filled a register yet) as slides are provided and lectures are also recorded. But it is also not as easy as it looks , there are some people who get 10 cg and there are some people who get cg less than 4.

Calcutta University awards degrees in Humanities,Arts, Engineering, Pure Sciences, Applied Sciences, Commerce and Accounts, Law, Pharmacy, Management, Journalism etc. Whereas BITS offers degrees only in Engineering, Pure Sciences, Pharmacy and Management. Though BITS has a humanities department it stands nowhere close to the humanities department of the University of Calcutta which offers degrees in more than 50+ areas. University of Calcutta admits a lot more students than BITS Pilani and has a lot more faculty members than BITS. This huge faculty and student base translates into much more number of research papers. University of Calcutta is much more diverse in terms of student population as compared to BITS when we talk about diversity in terms of caste, Creed and economic diversity. BITS due to lack of reservation is much less diverse than Calcutta University but BITS has a more diverse student population as almost people belonging to every state in the country are represented in huge numbers at BITS, this is something which isn't accounted for in NIRF rankings. BITS does a lot better than Calcutta University when it comes to education relating to science streams. Whereas Calcutta University though not comparable to BITS in areas of engineering,pure science, pharmacy and management does a pretty good job in these fields as well. Moreover Calcutta University does exceptionally well in non science areas. So since NIRF rankings takes the overall picture in mind, Calcutta University is ranked higher than BITS. BITS focusses in few academic areas where it does a exceptional work which Calcutta University cannot match. But Calcutta University does quite a good job in a lot more academic areas than BITS.

BITS Hyd Campus records the movements of students coming in and going out of campus by Bio-metric system. So, the administration knows if you are off campus for a long time without proper information. So, even though you don’t need the permission for road trips, you will need permission for staying out of campus. If your road trip ends in a day, have fun and be safe. On a safer note let your neighbors in hostel know your where about. Also BITS PILANI Hyd Campus will act for your safety in case of any emergency situation that you are stuck in. If for some reason you find that it is not possible for you to return back by the night. It is expected that you call up your warden and give a heads up regarding the situation. For girls the warden will contact the parents and will let them know of the situation. General protocol: Girls and Boys need to be back in their dorm/hostel rooms by around at 11:30–12:00 at night. You don’t need permission to go out of campus for a days work. You just punch in the bio-metrics at the main entrance and move in/out. Girls have a register and a separate bio-metric outside their hostels to mark their presence on campus. A warden later verifies the attendance and checks up on the missing entries to make sure they are on campus (or off campus with permission) ",0.10779999999999999,Positive,3.2156,0.0935672514619883,1,4.2156

Getting admission in CS at Stanford does not really relate to whether you choose one or the other campuses of BITS Pilani. It does matter that you belong to a good college. Belonging to a Tier-1 or Tier-2 college does shine in your application, but that plays a very liitle part in your admission. Stanford looks for far more than that. You should not only belong to a good college but also have the skills that you are supposed to have, better if you can tell Stanford how you applied what you learned in some project or any everyday subject that helped someone. Moreover, all the three campuses of BITS Pilani are considered equally well in the quality of education and enterpreneural motivation. The only difference they have is the time they were established. People prefer going to the main campus rather than the others, but choosing which campus to go does not matter for admission to Stanford. Stanford looks for how well you are doing in your class. If you can do good in Hyderabad campus and someone does not perform well in Goa campus, you get selected before the Goa guy. You need to be able to stand out. A university like Stanford that dominates every other university in the world has people sitting in the admissions department who are experts at their job. Being from a well known campus won't make them select you. Stanford looks into your profile to see how you can add value to their University, not on what campus you chose. Both campuses of BITS Pilani at Goa and Hyderabad are great and one can do well from any of them. Just work for what you want.

Good colleges create a positive image & provide a better platform for its student but that impression has a role upto certain extent and personal skills also matters a lot. And in today’s world of communication explosion creating platform for yourself is not such a big deal if you keep on your track yourself & work really very hard sincerely.

To answer your second part of your question, No, it is not necessary to qualify JEE or get a seat in IIT to enter BITS Pilani. However, many students here had a decent rank in JEE Mains/advanced and preferred BITS over similar branches in new IITs/NITs or lower branches in Old IITs. This definitely means that your IITJEE preparation is sufficient for BITSAT. You just got to work on your speed, accuracy, English and Logical reasoning. For that, try solving BITSAT test series.

Examination is totally online. you can not get question paper anywhere. So please don't try online for question papers. If you know the basics of your streams then it will be easy for you otherwise BITS HD is not at all a easy exam. The difficulty level of questions are more or less equivalent to gate only. The best thing about the exam is that you will get the score card on your computer screen after completing the examination. As we all know BITS Pilani is the premier private institution of India for engineering. So prepare hard for this exam. Negative marking is there for wrong response. Wrong answer -1 Correct answer +3 Test contains two sections part 1 and part 2. If you want more information about this exam. Then go to Facebook search bar. Type Bits me groups some groups are there you can join it for detailed information. Keep one thing in mind this exam is not like the Mtech exams of other private institutes like srm vit Amity Manipal etc. If you are preparing for gate then it will be easy for you to crack this exam.

I know of a guy who took mechanical engineering in BITS but was interested in ECE hence he never attended any class of mechanical but attended the ECE classes and followed his interest and made use of the 0 attendance system. He studied mechanical for exams and profs passed him with the impression that he works hard for ECE. In the end he became an entrepreneur in his field. Now PES is not a premium institute compared to BITS. PES is a money minded institution and behind its every action lies a financial gain. In 2014 it became a university free from VTU afliation and that allowed to conduct its own entrance exam known as PESSAT. It can control the fee structure for the PESSAT candidates and they are exorbitantly high and are more or less equal to that of BITS. The high fees is justifies if you take up computer science only. Because that's what PES is good at. Due to shifting of job market towards IT, it realised its gain in increasing CSE and ECE intake. They train these students for placements specifically and then brag about getting higher salary packages than NIT karnataka. This is true but mostly applies to the elite students who slog their ass off. Average students and their parents are lured into thus by the immense amount of advertising it puts up during admission process. They think that PES is good in placements. But what they don't know is that academic quality in PES is not that great. Hence the stupid rule of 85% attendance which for some reason is very random because other colleges are doing 75%.

To my dismay, I was not able to make it. I would have gotten into the less known NITs but I felt it wasn’t worth it. My best option in India at that time was BITS. As aforementioned, I had applied abroad and I made it to HKU, and also to NUS, the latter owing to my by chance brilliant board marks. I was thoroughly confused between the two options which I now had, i.e. BITS and NUS. After much research, I found out both colleges had certain points to their merit, but NUS had a global ranking and it made sense to go there. It was mere chance that my parents filled the applications for me and I made it there. For I did not think in my wildest dreams in the last 3–4 years that I would be studying abroad. I knew it would take time to sink in. I wasn’t even sure if I ever even wanted to go there. But, here I was, on a flight, with unknown people going to a country which was going to be full of unknown people. The first year was great. It took me a while to adjust and find my own group, but once I did, it was all fun. Little did I know, that the first bencher, grade A nerd would turn into a party freak. I was drinking, boozing, clubbing. I had a good and healthy balance. Second year was manageable, second half got hectic, but I managed. Third year, it became unbearable. I had explored the city, I was sick of my life in Singapore and I just did not want to see people that did not belong to India. I was homesick. I wanted to be with my family, my friends back home. I could not do anything as I was currently interning and I knew that I couldn’t go home for a minimum of 3 months. But that was not what made me sad. It was that I was a scholarship student and I had to compulsorily work for another 2 years once I graduate. It was then, that I finally recoursed to looking for companionship. Something I had never done in my entire life. Having talked about being an A grade nerd, I just had one childhood sweetheart who was in my heart till that day. Once I started seeking companionship, I realised it was easy for me to de stress via these outlets. Before I knew, I was dating someone a year younger to me. She was nothing like the girl I had ever dated, she was fun, bold and fresh. It was a lot of fun, in ALL aspects. But, time passed and I grew up. I was into my final year. I realised what a mess I had made. I had to get my life back on track. But it was too late. Damage had been done. My GPA had slipped that nothing could repair it. I was a mechanical engineering student, there weren’t a lot of jobs that would have anyway come on my way. But even those that could, owing to my poor networking skills, went down the drain. So yes, I repent my decision to not join BITS. Had I joined BITS I’m affirmative my life would not have turned out this way. I don’t seek to blame anyone but myself for my circumstances. if I stayed back, I feel the competition in BITS would have been healthy to encourage me to at least get a good campus placement along with taking the GRE/GMAT (since it’s a big centre for the exams). Competitor at NUS is way more overwhelming, that I guess it affected me in a negative way. I would not have been homesick and gone through the mix of emotions i did. I was miserable for months and I could never speak to anyone about it. I also feel I could have had a meaningful relationship, had I been in India. I still feel sad about not being able to rekindle with my childhood sweetheart. I still love her. I repent dating random girls. I saw my batchmates at BITS, They had a healthy balance throughout. I performed better than most of them in school and coaching tests, but they did way better than me later in life. But, I never let things get way out of hand. I did manage to get myself a job. I am about to complete the two years that I had to work here. I started visiting a therapist for my stress and mental problems. I am doing much better today. I am excited to go back and see what life has in store for me. Most importantly, I’m excited to finally stay with my parents for a few years. I have decided to go ahead with my dream of having my own business. Things have started looking good for me, but I regret not joining BITS and having a stable life. I would have been well established in my business, with my family and friends by my side. You can never take India out of an Indian. JAI HIND!

From brand point of view: No doubt, IIT is great. From specialisation point of view: ECE is better in this case. If you choose ECE, then you can directly get a core or an IT job from your campus but to get a core job in the field of metallurgy is very hard. You need to go for higher studies (Masters or upto PhD/MBA) or can try for PSUs through GATE in order to get a fat package in this field. Joining an IT company after having an engineering degree in the field of metallurgy doesn't make any sense.

This is one of the top notch competitive examinations of the country, and only those who adhere to its requirements shall be rewarded in the end. So, better start with understanding the ‘type’ of questions which appear to prepare for BITSAT in 1 month. Step 2: Download the syllabus and study it carefully if you feel soThis step is very much complementary to Step 1. However, to crack BITSAT in 1 month, you need to know the syllabus well. If you are someone who knows the JEE syllabus inside out, then you can safely skip this step. There isn’t much of a difference in the syllabus for JEE and BITSAT, when it comes to Mathematics, Physics and Chemistry. What makes BITSAT unique, however, is the section on Logical Reasoning and English Language. But, then again, you can have no prescribed syllabus for that! Step 3: Take a number of online testsThe importance of taking tests before the actual exam needs no special emphasis. As already pointed out, this is a ‘competitive exam’ and not a 2 year long course in college. More than your knowledge, what is valued in such exams is your ‘readiness’ to face it.Many students, equipped with a lot of knowledge and information, fail to make it through to the top ranks in this exam. This is because they rely too much on their ‘knowledge’ and not the ‘skills’ which have to be used here to ‘apply’ that knowledge. Especially for BITSAT, the speed at which you can solve the problems ought to be given top priority, over all other allied factors.Since BITSAT is an online exam, taking a number of online tests (preferably one each day) shall stand you in good stead when you appear for the actual exam. These tests will help you understand the problems that you are likely to face in BITSAT, and here it becomes necessary to scrutinize your mock tests performances closely. Tests taken without proper analysis might be tantamount to a colossal wastage of efforts. Step 4: Allot 1 hour everyday to reading a good newspaperThis might seem weird to those who are still not clear about the format of the exam. Here, out of 150 questions, 25 are reserved for Logical Reasoning and English Proficiency. Neither of these two areas can be tackled using conventional sit-study-revise techniques which are viable for PCM. To make the best use of the 25 questions, do make it a habit of reading a good national newspaper on a daily basis. If you have been an avid reader throughout your childhood, then this section might turn out to be a cakewalk for you. Step 5: For PCM, earmark specific areas to concentrate onBITSAT won’t test your intelligence the way JEE does by framing slightly tricky questions. You can crack BITSAT in 1 month, armed just with the crystal clear concepts from NCERT. So, there is no need to go running for various books, if you are planning to take this exam within a month. Focus on a few key areas of Physics, Chemistry and Mathematics which are going to maximise your returns, and go for the rest of the topics only if you have time. Physics – Mechanics (Newton’s Laws, Work and Energy, Rotational Dynamics etc), Thermodynamics (this will fetch you marks like nothing else), Electrostatics and Electromagnetism. Mathematics – You are likely to get almost 50% of the paper from Integral Calculus, Differential Calculus, Coordinate Geometry and Complex Numbers. Make sure you know their basics very well. Chemistry – Try and go for a ride with NCERT for Inorganic Chemistry. Getting the basics right for Ionic Equilibrium, Chemical Equilibrium and Gas Laws might come in handy for Physical Chemistry. If you are comfortable with Organic Chemistry, go for a quick revision, else skip it. You are not likely to grasp the complex mechanisms of Organic Chemistry too soon!Also, do keep in mind the important dates for BITSAT and keep track of our preparations.

To be frank it varies from campus to campus ( Goa being infamous for lowest avg Cg) and course to course. It is at a complete discretion of the IC( instructer in charge) of that course. Frankly speaking, I was among those people who used to crib a lot about CG and average grading and all, ( fun fact - I still am :P) , but the only thing that seems to have changed is, now I see it sometimes from the faculty's point of view. While we all want average grading of B in courses, but in reality the average of the paper is generally low. Say that the average of a course is around around 150 out of a total of 300 which is nearly 50%. Then I guess the instructor would be compelled to give a pretty bad grade just around average (like C or something). But at the same time, in Lab courses or humanities courses, the averages are generally pretty high and yes, Gradings are relatively better( No pun intended). So yes, grading is tougher, but then again, there are definitely a few people who'll get 9+ cg, 8+cg and may be a few who get 10 , but then again, most of them are hovering at around 7. Yes it does have a drastic effect on getting foreign internships or MS. Now to analyze this situation, I guess either the instructors may be adviced to improve the grading, but at what cost? I feel if they simply improve the grade without the effort done by student, everyone will start taking it lite. Well in that scenario what I feel is, may be they can reduce the burden or reduce the unnecessary syllabus to reduce stress and hence improve overall study quotient of the student. Further, last but not the least, the question papers. Frankly although most of the time we prepare a few days before the actual exams, and we are completely off from what boards and jee used to be, here the questions seem difficult , but then again, if we are taught to not tackle problems , then where do we improve? Afterall we cleared one of the toughest exams and here we are. I don't know to what extent this is true, but apparently the BITS curriculum is more stringent and vast than the IIT curriculum i.e. tougher. So may be, some might find it a bit difficult to cope up and hence lose their cg. See the dilemma? Quality vs quanity of cg? Anyways, overall I feel, the system atleast should be uniform and transparent and overall if you ask why BITS follows this system? Well my answer would be, well this is what the system has evolved to be. Atleast we don't have the absolute grading ( some NIT still have that ). Well I guess with time and when instructors finally realize this, I guess they'll also improving the scenario. Because Ultimately even they want us to learn and prove them our capabilities.

I think it was due to the skewed ratio of students from South India who outnumbered other state students. AFAIK, the 12th board marks of south Indians on an average much higher than the UP, Bihar and many other North Indian states. Apart from this, it was very difficult to ascertain the quality of students as some boards are rigorous in promoting understanding while some are focussed fully on rote learning making it difficult to get parity. AFAIR it was in the year 2005, BITSAT as a computer-based entrance test introduced by the then Dean for Pilani and Goa campuses.

Research at BITS isn't very active, but BITSians get an opportunity to do a 3rd or 4th* year internship at a research institute or even a 6 months research internship (thesis as we call it), which gets added the student's profile but not in university's research output. (*: Dual degree) Dual degree students get a chance to do two six months internships in their final year (5th year). This 6 months internship programme is a unique academic flexibility that most Indian institutions like IITs and NITs and IIITs don't offer. (There might be some exceptions.) However, for summer internships, it becomes difficult to get a good internship with BITS tag, because foreign professors prefer only top IITians. Also, in some particular research areas like machine learning, embedded systems, VLSI design, IoT and in pure sciences like chemistry, computational biology etc, campus research is also quite strong. Also, we have a practice school 1 programme for 2nd year internships. In a handful number of research stations like CEERI, IGCAR, etc, students get real research work. But, one should consider doing MS or PhD only if one is willing to go into academia or one wants a job in foreign countries. Indian Industry doesn't value such advanced degrees all that much. And, number of actual research jobs like those at Google research or Microsoft research are very few. From the CS alumni that I know, a lot of people do normal software development work after doing an MS. (I am still an undergraduate, so I might be wrong.)

I don’t really think that BITSians are really successful. I am a BITSian so I know how things work inside the college. My understanding is that the foremost thing about BITS is that the student acceptance rate is less than 1.5% and unlike IITs, there’s no reservation. When you accept only students who were meritorious to the extent of being in the top 1.5% of lakhs of aspirants, the probability of them being successful later in life increases. This is because a student who worked hard enough to be in the top 1.5% would likely be more driven and focused about his/her future than a person who didn’t make the cut in the top 1.5%. Another aspect to note is that there are a few friends of mine who spent a year at an IIT/NIT/IIIT/local college and rewrote the BITSAT next year and joined BITS. Now, these guys have repeatedly told us that the grading system at BITS is A LOT worse than that at an IIT/NIT/IIIT/local college and that a student who score a C in a course at BITS is definitely more meritorious than one who score a B or even an A at the IIT/NIT/IIIT/local college. This means that compared to the students of other colleges, we are required to strive harder throughout our college life, which makes us more capable of handling pressure in corporate life or during our post grad. The third aspect is not a comparison to most IITs/NITs/IIITs but is a comparison to some of them (some because some of IITs/NITs/IIITs are newly established and still lack in most aspects to the older BITS campuses) and the local colleges. The fact that you spend 4 or 5 years of your life in a college with better services and infrastructure, has a deep impact on your personality. To be blunt, it makes you better groomed to face the corporate world. To make my point, I’ll inform you that IIM Indore has started a 5 year dual BBA-MBA program because they noticed that the students who spent 3/4/5 years at a local college need to be groomed in the 2 year MBA program to make them hireable. On the other hand, a student who spends 5 years of his/her life at IIM Indore will already be groomed enough to face the corporate world. The peers around you make a world of difference to how you finally turn out at the end of engineering. Since BITS is highly selective of the students enrolled, they ensure that your peer group is amongst the best you could find in the country. The same can not be said about IITs/NITs/IIITs because 50% of the seats are reserved and thus, the peer group is also composed of students who aren’t really deserving of the seat offered to them.

The man needs no introduction. He is famous for his movie reviews in all three campuses. He was called for Oasis this year but couldn’t go due to his busy schedule. He stayed in campus to watch Andhadhun and release its review. He decides all the movies which are to be screened by Film Screening Club of BITS Goa. He is also an integral member of FMAC - Film Making Club of BITS Goa. He is set to become the next Coordinator of the club and take it to great heights. His first review that he ever wrote was of movie Get Out which can be read below. It is the highest rated review ever written in history of IMDB. One of the best thrillers I have come across in a very long time. The movie uses a concept so surreal and original that the average Joe can almost confuse it with an incident based on true events. And that is the wonder that is this movie. It makes you wonder and ponder and then it scares the shit out of you at the possibility of it. The first part of the movie builds up the tension in the right amount; in the sense that something is wrong but you are likely to attribute that feeling to your hunger of thrills and is actually nothing but that is the genius. It uses a fair share of symbolism as well. So in the latter part when the grand scheme of things happening is revealed you are scared as fuck (and even more) because it is more than what you expected. The concept used is so original that it is about possible happening somewhere around the corner of the world- genius of the movie. The movie addresses the issue of racism in a such an eccentric way that it strikes you hard-praise the attributes of the blacks but hate them for it. This concept is original that I could have watched the movie just for this sake. Everything in the movie is flawless-from the acting to the direction. I couldn't name a single flaw in the movie. It even occurs to me that this movie surpasses my respect to what I hold for 'Shutter Island' and that happens on just one front, i.e., original content. Can't praise the movie enough. So just watch the movie already if you haven't already. 10/10 According to rumors IMDB offered him a CTC of 69 Lakh to keep writing more reviews but he refused the offer because he had the vision that everyone should get free and proper access to his reviews. He posts his reviews as Whatsapp Statuses these days. Whatsapp went down the day he released his review of AndhaDhun. The red line shows the outage reports of Whatsapp when Srijan released his review.  One can’t write amazing reviews without access to Microsoft Word. If you will go to the LinkedIn page of the man himself then you will get to know about his excellence in Microsoft products. The man can write reviews on AutoCad too!

Fast forward a year after graduation, I got admitted to the Masters of Finance program at Massachusetts Institute of Technology. That two year “lag” stopped mattering a long time ago :) My younger brother has a similar story. He had to wait till the last round of iterations to get admitted to BITS. He was getting a Comp. Sci undergrad in a decent college, but having walked down that path, I strongly advised (and convinced) my parents to let him go to BITS. And based on how he’s doing, I’d say it was the right call :) At the end of the four years, it is not the academics or the stuff that you learned in your syllabus that matters (Not that you shouldn’t focus). More than the pedagogy, more than the professors, it is the environment, your peers, that has a lasting influence on your life. The folks who make it to BITS are some of the smartest people in the country, and help you expand out of your comfort zone (The heat also does that to you btw). BITS will not be easy, but your career prospects, and the network that you get from that place will help you all your life. Of course, your undergrad is not going to be the last milestone of your life, and you still have to work hard no matter where you go, but it definitely helps to start off on a strong footing.

I have seen students, failing to secure an admission in BITS or IIT even after their second attempt. It finally results in too much frustration for the student as well as the parents. Also, even if you to manage to secure a admission in BITS or an IIT in your second attempt, when dream companies come for placement, some have the basic eligibility criteria that a student should NOT have taken a drop throughout his academics. In such a scenario, you would be eliminated even before taking the screening tests. So, my suggestion would be to take an admission into a course of your choice and prepare for the entrance exams simultaneously!!!

The advantage of this is that many of us get time to pursue are interests and yet we gain enough knowledge to make ourselves employable. This also prevents burnt out to certain extent in my opinion.Extremely small size + highly westernised population + Administration support:- BITS has got only 3000(BE , MSc and BPharm)students in total across the 3 campuses where as all the IITs combined have got 12000 seats and the NITs have around 18000(This number will increase even further since they’re adding more supernumerary seats for girls plus the new IITs will increase their batch size in the due course of time).Plus everybody in BITS has got an extremely good command over English which makes it easier for us to try for jobs in the non core profile(which to be brutally honest are the bread and butter placements of BITSians in non CS/Electrical branches). By having a small batch size placements can be managed much more easily, plus the placement cell of all the 3 campuses are in regular contact with each other. The same is definitely not true for other colleges where each one of them operates as an individual entity.Teaching courses which are more relevant to industry:- More than 50% of the batch in BITS graduates with either a CSE/Electrical/Economics/Maths degree, all of which are highly in demand in the industry(CS and EE guys go for IT, Eco guys can get into IB and Math guys in analytics jobs) and the concept of dual degree only adds to the charm MSc Eco+ CS is an extremely lucrative offer. Many of my friends even with MSc Chemistry + ENI were placed pretty well. Plus at the same time BITS has gutted it’s core departments like Civil , Mechanical and Chemical engineering removing any kind of serious rigour in the courses from them and instead introducing Minor degrees like Finance which gives these people a short into get into the more lucrative industries like IB and Analytics. Most BITSians who’re genuinely interested in these subjects usually go for MS abroad where they get better quality education and prospects otherwise they just do an MBA.BITSAA:- BITSians are loyal to BITS like rabid dogs. The loyalty which BITSians have got towards BITS is second to none and this cuts across generations and campuses and batches and degrees. Plus the kind of ostracization we face from the outside world(“JEE Hila Nahi toh BITS Pilani”,”Oh it is a private institute” HURTS A LOT) only further enforces this in us. Plus when you’ve got such alumni in high places(The current president of Microsoft India is a BITSian, founders of Swiggy and Bigbasket are BITSians, Chief Business Officer of Uber India is a BITSian), these people ensure that the various companies come for recruiting no matter what.PS School:- Practice school , plus extremely cooperative placement cell only give another leg up to us during the placement season which helps us even more. Many finance firms hire via the PS2 route only and companies like Apple also recruit via that route also.

Also, there is quite a boom in demand for Software Engineers which is making company consider many colleges apart from IIT, BITS and NITs, hence again, CS Placements go up. The companies which go at IITs, come at BITS and vice-versa. Many companies have a certain criteria, that the campus should “x” years old enough, and it is generally less than 10. This year, BITS Goa completed its 10 years of graduating batches, hence, we clear this criteria for almost all companies. Effort from Placement Unit from BITS Goa has also been great, right from helping students on preparation material to mock interviews. Moreover, I feel that college is now hardly playing any role in placements of a student, given that a student is well equipped with the skills that a company desires for. Available of so many online courses, videos, books has made it quite easier for students in non - IITs and non - BITS to access quality. Example, NPTEL from IIT professors, EdX, Coursera etc.So, given a chance to sit for a company it shouldn’t be astounding if a non-IITian also bags a equally decent offer as an IITian would. These days it is not quite surprising even if a non-CS student gets a equivalent offer as of that of a CS student, leave apart being a IITian CS student or BITSian CS student, cause again, branch/college are not a very big consideration for most of the companies.

I am a dualite from BITS Pilani, Pilani Campus pursuing MSc Eco + BE CSE. After spending a year studying the course, I think I am quite eligible to answer this question. A Person first needs to give BITSAT - An examination conducted every year by BITS Pilani, for admissions in the undergraduate courses. He/she then needs to register for the counseling procedure, through which he/she can get selected for a particular course at BITS Pilani - Hyd, Goa or Pilani Campus.Initially, a person gets admission for a BE course or M.Sc. course. He/She can then pair up his/her degree, with a second degree by registering for the dual degree program. Several dual degree programs are available - BE+BE, MSc + BE and MSc + MSc. Selection for a particular branch in the dual degree program depends upon the CG obtained by the end of the first year.Generally, when a person talks about a dual degree program at BITS Pilani, he/she is referring to MSc+BE program. This program is quite popular since it gives kinda second and a secure chance for pursuing your desired branch. One can get admissions to MSc programs at lower BITSAT scores and All MSc students are eligible for a dual degree program with BE(if they score >5 CG in the first year).Dual Degree Programs have a tenure of 5 years. All undergraduate courses at BITS Pilani have the same course structure for the first year(except B.Pharma). The second year only has courses from the MSc branch and the following two years have courses from both the MSc and BE branches. The last year is meant for PS and a compulsory thesis.Contrary to normal undergraduate courses, dual degree programs provide less flexibility and heavier course burden.That’s all folks! Peace!

Generally, you should perform well in your courses and take electives that relate to the subject. Having a good CGPA would be important as your Practice School* station depends on it. Practice School is a part of curriculum at BITS where you go to an industry / corporate for internship.Having a PS at JP Morgan, Credit Suisse, Morgan Stanley etc. would help your profile and maybe, you'd get an offer based on your performance and their requirement.

This policy was opted to provide the students to do things like I mentioned above. But the argument is that most students have taken it in the other way. They don't attend the classes just coz they don't have to, they consider it as their leisure time and don't do anything productive either and end up having no knowledge and talent in their discipline nor do they have any other Co curriculur talent, which at last ruins that student's life. This concept of recording the attendance came in because they want to collect the data of students so that they can check whether attendance and performance of the students are related or not. They just are collecting the data so that they can prove their argument with some concrete evidence, because since 2017 it ahe been found that the students who attends the classes have a better performance than those who don't. In the end this is all because, now, the BITS administration is considering to impose attendance if the above argument is proven.

Probably like most people, I was looking forward to the picturesqe scenery along the way. As you probably expected, this was not to be. Our driver, due to some miscommunication, did not know the way. The thing they say about partial knowledge being a dangerous thing is pretty true. He half followed google maps (limited signal) and we ended up going through the same area twice. Needless to say, it took us any extra hour to reach our hotel. The hotel is supposed to be one of the best in Pilani, though I can’t comment on that as its the only hotel in Pilani I’ve been to. Almost all the rooms were occupied by freshers and their families. So, we had a good chat about what each of us expected. That evening, some of the freshers went to campus to see which rooms they had been alloted. Its a completely computerized and random process here at BITS. My dad and I chose to wait till the next day, when we were actually supposed to go for all the paperwork, submission of certificates and all that stuff. I had a hard time falling asleep that night. I was excited and looking forward to tomorrow, but was apprehensive at the same time. The next morning, we went to campus. And wow !!. The campus is literally an oasis in the middle of the desert. These massive gates swung open as our auto entered the gates. Next, we were supposed to go to the New Academic Block (called NAB). Its the latest academic block where the computer science, humanities and mathematics departments are housed. Here, I submitted a few documents and got a timetable book as well as my room number and hostel. It was the Srinivas Ramanujan (SR) bhawan, the hostel exclusively for freshers. Its a temporary hostel, with wooden walls. But, that place is something else. Its like a resort, with several walkways and lush greenery with peacocks and a plethora of bird species. I went to my allotted room and met with my roommate’s parents as he was elsewhere with his friends. Next, we went to another academic area for submission of certificates. Next, my dad and I headed of the supermarket, Akshay, which has almost alll of the items anyone would need on campus. We bought bedding, a bucket, cleaning supplies and some toiletries. Finally, we set up my room. My dad left after that. He would come back in the morning before going back home. That evening, I probably had the most fun I’ve ever had. That was the start of an epic year at Bits Pilani. This was the year where I developed socially, emotionally and intellectually. I feel that the way to lead your life at college has a tremendous impact on how you lead your life later on as an adult. I suggest making smart and responsible choices to all those planning to study here. Make the most out of this wonderful oppurtunity provided to you.

So I was not habitual to sit in a classroom and glance at the PowerPoint presentation. Opposite to this, I always had someone to work for him i.e. take care of my tea (thrice a day) and lunch. I just need to go to the office, sign some documents, give a visit to the plant and spend the rest of the day in my office. I was almost at the edge of spoiling myself and was the major reason for coming back to this classroom. On the first day, we had lectures from morning to lunch which was followed by a lab session of 3 hrs. In classes, professors were going through the ppt and I could hardly get something out of it. It was like a generation has been passed and so many new things came into science in the last six months. Other students sitting in the classroom look like a genius to me, because they were well prepared to answer anything asked in the class. I was literally nervous and got some inferiority complex from those students. A similar thing happened during the lab session and most of the time in the lab I used to stand and observe the experiment that I am supposed to perform in my next lab session, to make sure I am not going to spoil the experiment. They knew everything related to the experiment; what chemical has to be used and where they are kept. So things were interesting and tedious at the same time. So I started questioning myself, did I made a mistake by leaving the job, can I cope up with these talented people? BITS is described as a beautiful quote “BITS Pilani-Its Magic.” 1. People outside BITS describes it as an esteemed engineering college. 2. For engineering aspirants students; it's a dream. 3. For the parents of engineering aspirants, it's a bright future for their son. 4. For a BITSIAN it’s the best feeling he/she ever had in their life. 5. Unforgettable moments of four years of some one’s life. BITS Pilani is deemed to be a University and should be called like that according to the new norms of UGC (2017). It established as a University in 1964 when a law was passed where colleges can get the affiliation of University and BITS was the first Deemed to be the University of India. It was inaugurated by famous educationist and politician Madan Mohan Malviya and the architecture of the college was designed by Shri Shukradev Pandey. -Between the year of 1964-1970 with the help of Ford foundation faculties of BITS Pilani were sent to MIT to learn their education system and exam pattern, and the same was adopted at BITS (Yes, open-book exams really suck). When I entered BITS eight years back it looks like this.  With time there was a complete transformation of BITS with a budget of ~400 crores and now it looks like this.  BITS Library: BITS Pilani, Pilani campus library has room for up to 8,000 students, offers 738 open-access study places, and 246 open-access IT work stations. As well as the books and periodicals you expect, it is home to computing facilities for students.  Freedom at all level: BITS does not have any sitting arrangement during its semester examination, so you can sit anywhere in your respective classrooms and give your exam.The course structure is designed in such a way that you can make your own timetable and select your own course (other than engineering).Not always produces an engineer: If you are in BITS, then most probably you won’t end up as an engineer. It gives you an overall development which helps you to choose your profession.Best Alumni association BITSAA: BITS Pilani has a strong Alumni association (that is socially active) and most of the associative members are big personalities, which makes the institution famous.Pioneer in so many things: BITSAT was the first online exam conducted by any University as an admission test, where students can select their slots to give entrance test in the time span of 40 days (Now only 7 to 10 days).BITS was the first college that started with the dual degree and integrated courses and also gives a four year Master's degree in various subjects.An online registration system for every semester for students.BITS timetable which details more than 500 courses with very few chances of course clashes.Cheers to all BITSIAN..

It's common knowledge that the Goa campus is the smallest of the three campuses in India. Even then, I've already started feeling the pain of walking all day and night around the campus (we're not allowed to keep cycles). After reporting for hostel allotment, and before the classes actually start, you'll have 2 to 4 days to explore the campus and meet new people, depending on when you choose to arrive, before classes start. Firstly, I'll recommend you to get outside your room and meet new people. Just talk to everyone you meet on the way. That's how you'll make friends. Don't hesitate, almost none of the people know each other from before and everyone's looking for new friends to make. Eventually you'll filter out the people you'd actually want to spend time with later on, but it's imperative that you make as many acquaintances as possible. Since there's no curfew time to get into the hostel, you can explore the campus at night time too. You'll find a lot of people just walking around. Find a group, and they'll probably welcome your company. For the first few days, the hostel common rooms will be turned into makeshift shops to buy essentials from, so you won't get to use the TT, or carrom tables. The Students Activity Centre will also be occupied by admission authorities, so you won't be able to play anything untill the admissions are probably over. You can always hangout at Red Chillies, or Ice and Spice, or the institute cafeteria if you're feeling hungry. For the most part, there's no boundation on where you can sit and talk in general. We've literally hung out in the corridors of the B-Dome (which is the main academic building) at midnight, and nobody stopped us. Classes generally start around the first week of August, and the load is light for the first week or so, so you probably shouldn't be stressed about studying. Just make sure to attend the lectures and tutorials: they're important. If you want to though, you can go out to explore Goa, especially on a weekend. We recently went to the Bogmalo beach, and it was a fun trip. Beware though, the cabs are costly, and will burn a hole in your pockets. Don't come back to the campus drunk: it's a big no-no. If they find something amiss, they will breathalyse you at the gate, and you'll end up in trouble if caught. For a lot of cases, especially when your new friends have been allotted different hostels, the only place you'll meet is the mess. But, you can order from Dominos if you're already tired of mess food. The only downside is that you have to go all the way to the main gate to collect your order, so start walking towards it as soon you place your order: that's a passtime in itself. You can also sit back in your room and install a DC++ client to browse and download all content on the DC servers that your seniors are running, but I wouldn't recommend that you stay in your room- the first couple weeks are crucial in forming bonds and friendships that will last for 4 years, and in a lot of cases, even beyond. Bottomline is that there's a lot to do on the first few days of college, and specifically a decent amount of things here at BPGC, but it all depends on what you choose to do. I would again reiterate the importance of making friends. Keep your doors open when you sit in your room and just socialize. BITSP is a place where you can grow, and you need to socialize with everyone to hone your personality. I've been here less than a fortnight, and I've already found great friends here- friends that'll probably last a lifetime. Maybe I wouldn't have if I'd decided to spend the night of 28th July in my hostel room. Trust me when I say: you need to socialize! Above all, take it lite. You indeed realize after you've been here a while: BITS Pilani - It's Magic. ",0.07167804878048781,Positive,3.1433560975609756,0.07602339181286549,1,4.143356097560975

I’ll tell you about my experience. It may have varied slightly this year (2018). Once, you arrive on campus, usually 2 - 3 days before registeration day (its when we make our own timetables), you are supposed to visit the NAB(New Academic Block). There you get a couple of documents verified and you recieve a timetable manual with all the courses of the first semester of that year and a slip with your hostel and room no on it. At BITS Pilani, all fresher dorms are doubles, unless you happen to be quite lucky (in my opinion) and don’t have a roommate for whatever reason. Now for most people, the first and probably the most obvious question that comes to mind is “Who’s gonna be my roommate?”. Of course, at BITS Pilani, the occupants of each double room (for freshers) is completely random and you have no option of knowing who your roommate is before hand. Anyway, after you recieve those documents, you can either go for the remaining verification where you submit your certificates or visit your dorm room. There, you fill your details in a record book and thats it. After you ‘re done with everything (official stuff), you have to buy set up your room. Stuff like a mattress, bucket, etc. All of this is available at the Akshay Supermarket on campus. For the next day or two, you’ll just be attending orientations on various topics which I found pretty interesting. Currently, there is one hostel which is exclusively for freshers. Its actually a temporary hostel from what I’ve heard with wooden walls. But its pretty good and will be always be my favourite hostel. The hostel is the centre of most activities for a student on campus. You relax, socialize, study and play there. I feel its pretty important to set your priorities early on (how long you’re going to study, how can many clubs you’re going to join…) so that you can enjoy your new found freedom with your friends. Of course, many people misuse that freedom and regret it later. So its better not to get too carried away. At the time of writing this answer, the 2018 freshers batch is already on campus. Hope to see the rest of you on campus! ",0.13158709677419356,Positive,3.2631741935483873,0.07602339181286549,1,4.263174193548387

Then you’ll enter the section number for your tutorials. Again, you’ll be shown the timetable. This will continue till you have filled up all your tutorials and lectures numbers.

Once you have a clash-free timetable, you’ll be prompted to make sure these are the numbers you agree upon: or you can still make changes.

B.Pharm at BITS allows students to study various interdisciplinary subjects covering many of the engineering subjects as well.

If BITS is ineligible, Why did they even give this Institute of Eminence thing if it did not adhere there regulations in first place? It's quite frustrating that the fact they considered BITS as IOE and now are discarding the status causing unnecessarily defamation of the institute.Also, UGC will no longer be functional and will be replaced by different system in near future so it's just entirely pointless. Thesw evidences point out incompetency of government.This IOE thing itself is pointless as it doesn't really change anything except the fact that public universities will be granted extra funds.Considering BITS, all it did was caused unnecessary embarrassment and defamed institute when in fact it's there own mistake. I do respect concerns of aspirants but if anyone is leaving out BITS as option for these reasons, I would say you are missing a good opportunity to study in such a good institution.

To know where your interest don’t try to compare with what you learnt in those subjects in 12th or 10th because they are quite different at school level and undergrad level. To know which you like more go over the course structure of the respective subjects which is available on the BITS Pilani website.

To know which you like more go over the course structure of the respective subjects which is available on the BITS Pilani website. Knowing your interest is very important as you’ve got to study the subject at quite a high level(MSc) and if you do not find it interesting then it will be quite hard for you to score a good CGPA (your total CGPA is calculated using both your BE and MSc CGPA) as you’ll not like studying the subject and you’ll always regret it. So if you like physics then go for BITS Pilani, Goa campus, else if Bio interests you then go for BITS Pilani, Pilani campus. Secondly, in my opinion always prefer branch over campus. If you’re really sure about having CS as your second degree then you’ll have to really work hard on after coming to BITS and also, a ‘slightly’ higher percentage of dual degree students get CS as their second degree at the Goa campus(In no way does this mean that you’ll not have to work as hard, it’s just a fact). So to conclude, the main deciding factor in your decision should be if you like physics more or biology. Hope this answer was helpful!

Both my son are now in the branch of their choice and continue to do well. Both have gone abroad for their intern. Take my guidance seriously and you will be the winner. You don't have to do anything extra and just have to show the same phase( perhaps little less) that you did for JEE. IIT-M also offers you the flexibility to take a lot of subjects of your choice and you could also look at dual degree. A chance to change the branch I believe is available based on the subjects you take and performance even in the third year. Also there are several clubs , C5 an innovative center where you can horn your skills in the area of your interest. Here, you have a chance to work with your seniors and Geeks very closely. Students have developed Land Rovers which will go to mars , satellites which will be launched soon, make cars which go for competition at Global level( F1S race),. Research park another plus and unique to IITM where incubation center's for start up are there. Enjoy and indulge in extra curricular activities , take up Yoga , physical exercise in their 5 star gym, be a long distance runner,work in the departments up to wee hours etc. Overall one of the best Institute and headed by an alumni and a fine person and most of the Deans are ex -IITan’s who will appreciate your problems.

Circuit branches i.e EEE , ECE ENI and CSE and their further sub- branches have placements averaging 15–18 lakhs annually , the only problem bits has in this situation, is that it does not let everyone sit in IT placement, you need to have to take up courses related to that line. But IIT does not have those restrictions. Core branches i.e civil, mechanical , chemical , metallurgy etc have a somewhat better placement in IIT Roorkee followed by BITS later by IIT BHU, but also mechanical engineer is allowed to sit in IT job interview at IIT , and not at BITS, so that is a disadvantage of BITS in core lines. Dual degree , IIT provide Bs+ Ms or btech+ mtech , whereas BITS provides BE+ msc , placements are much better in IIT in this case as mtech and Ms plays a significant role during placements, and mtech from any IIT is always deemed best in India. Now you can see all these stats differ field wise and placements depend on your talent and knowledge, but the factor that anyone can sit in IT placement makes IIT better placement wise, and fees are also less in IIT , so consider that and ROI is better in IIT than BITS.

Cutoffs are always unpredictable like a coin toss and none of us(students nor the administration themselves) can predict. They all depend on the number of vacant seats available in that branch.
