You can't walk without bumping into someone. Being a student in VIT, I've realized that VIT is all about outer beauty just to attract more students into joining the college. And the worst part is they keep admitting more and more students every year. They have spent crores of rupees, just to rebuild the existing main gate.... Instead they could have built the tunnels properly which we students use every single day to go to our class. The tunnel is filled with drainage water and we have to walk through it. For students having classes at 8 o'clock, the tunnel gets so crowded that it takes nearly 10 mins just to pass through it. VIT keeps increasing the number of students but not the facilities inside the college for the students. Currently, there are nearly 30k students in VIT and 10 shuttle cabs. Each shuttle cab can accommodate at most 10 people. So during rainy days, only 300 students would be able to use the cab(considering the cab drivers can make 3 trips during the busy hours) .
