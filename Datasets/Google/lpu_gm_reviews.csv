It is up-to-date and linked closely with employer demands making our students ‘best fits’. Curriculum, teaching & learning, and assessment strategies are fruitfully aligned with the planned learning outcomes and reflect the achievement of higher order learning and mastery rather than traditional education approach of direct instruction of facts and accumulation of credits. It’s a value based education system. From development of applications to wonderful innovations like Quadcopter, Gesture controlled wheelchair, Autonomous Rover etc., our education system is dedicatedly converting the brick and mortar classroom to outcome based learning.

Overall a nice place for students who have been looking for other alternatives than NIT and IIT.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURJNzk2OWRREAE,"LPU has 25K students and 6K-10K pass outs every year. And they are running the University from last 12 years. Now 6–10K students passing out and only a bunch of them are in big companies! (Less than 50 students I guess). How statistically significant is that? (Check their alumni page, 5–10 names and rest it's a laughing stock).  Secondly, Those students, that lpu keeps boasting about (Placed in Apple and Google and Amazon), just graduated from LPU, they later did GATE and got into IITs and some of them went abroad. They worked for years and then got into these big companies and LPU has 0% share in their success virtually. It's like your School is taking credit for your IAS once you are selected. Imean you are getting it aren't you!  And third thing is the advertisements you see of Lovely Professional University are just like any other advertisement, made to influence peoples perception and no truth lies behind them. They are like those Fair and lovely advertisements where you neither get fair nor Lovely.  Now let me tell you about my experiences at LPU.  First thing is that they don't have any quality Faculty in the entire University, that's the only reason you don't find the faculty profiles on their website because those faculties don't have any good academic reputation. They don't have any good research careers and most of them are LPU pass outs. If they are eager to show everything about their University why don't they show the faculty profiles?  Secondly they have a very good infrastructure and malls and everything else you need. But will those malls and buildings add anything to your knowledge? Or will they make you creative? They work on capitalistic framework and the students are treated as consumers.  Third point, the Libraries are pathetic. You will never find any academically valuable manuscript there. Just books of Indian authors and nothing good. And the libraries are used as romance corners by students who come there to spend time with girls and not to study!  Fourth Point, Fee Structure: They charge hefty sums of money as fee, even the examination fee and hostel fees are very high. 50K for a 4 tier non AC room!! That's the real source of their income.  Fifth point, Not a single faculty from IIT background or from premier institutes like IIS, Delhi University or even NITs.  Sixth point, the Percentage of Academicians who visit Lovely Professional University is less than 5%. 95% people are Musicians, Actors, Comedians and Other Artists. Who have no academic Background. During my years at Lovely Professional University I haven't seen any good Academician entering the gates of Lovely Professional University.  Seventh point is they have good safety and security inside the campus. But they have used this thing also to their benefit. Now you will ask how? If they will find your hanging out with a girl or even hugging her inside the campus, you will get an indiscipline case and you will be charged 2000 rupees as fine. And you will be treated as if you are son of Osama bin Laden and you have done some great kand. Every day they collect thousands of rupees as fine even for small mistakes. (So don't go after the advertisement that you will get a lot of girls there, if you are couple in lpu then your life is hell inside the campus).  . .  .",a year ago,2020-07-22 20:54:20.537008,5.0,Radhakrishna3579,0,0,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103529809116818244310?hl=en-IN

Looks the university is very poor and is in conition where not able to provide a mug and room lock also.  Anyway they are not providing bed to students.  Hostel is too dirty and never cared on cleaning either in hostel or outside the hostel.  Dogs are roaming in the hostel and making dirt.  There are security guards but they never bother about dogs.  Basically wardens are not interested in cleanliness.  Otherwise they would have got the hostel cleaning before sudents reached to the hostel.  I can say staff are too negligent on taking care of the hostel and facilities.  My advise to management and staff to maintain some cleanliness in hostel and premises. Also advise staff not to threaten students if any one try to complaint on hostel cleanliness and facilities.

When you try to approach the administration for your problem, they misbehave with you. Pethatic administration, is what I'd say. Coming to education, they only have big buildings. No intellectual capital. Most of the teachers are in their 30s. Many teachers are B Tech graduates and teaching B Tech students. And in such a situation (such a pathetic environment), you are forced to attend 76% classes. The university administration lies that it is a UGC rule, while it's not. It's their own stupid rule. Overall, a very bad place to be. I'm stuck in here. Better stay away.

At most occasions LPU is strict against defaulters but when its not perfect systems fails (be it UMS or straightaway individual authority promises) they still blame it on the students (in case of late  fee submission etc. ) . LPU boasts largest university and you get to see it if you make it the other end of its 600 acre diameter on the mechanical block. it appears that on purpose the building with most stuffed classes are at the end which are a perfect strategy to bloat the immense swarming strength. In hostels too you cannot visit your friends room , and if opted to live off-campus then you certainly find habitable places across 2-3 km radius and then make to the gate to your classes which probably is 500ms away from gate but wait, you forgot the card and pay about some bucks to get a provisional ID and make it to classes where the attendance can only be deducted and if by mistake marked absent at teachers fault it won't be rectified but it can certainly be deducted. you find this a bit amusing , just call the LPU and ask for remaining seats which they will tell is about to go full in a short time and hurry , whereas if you pay a visit it would already be going on and on and they keep stuffing the students. why 3* then, well because I did not knew how to make is 2.5 and it's not all hails and storms , you can get decent scholarship and a good appeal to you surroundings , a helping library and a few good things . but there is severe harsh punishment for the failures as example you have to pay 1/10 of your fee if you fail. and the cheking all goes hit and trial , on several occasions i felt that i would get 75+ marks but instead i failed and never get to see the copies .  at every point LPU steps in to ask for money money money and more money. I'd say if you wish to pay money and work hard for a dime it's better you learn from your mistakes , face your parents and instead don't pay unnecessarily , work hard for the Diamond and try not to fall in here .",4 years ago,2020-07-22 21:00:11.676592,3.0,Gaurav Chand,0,0,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114808646273150956949?hl=en-IN
